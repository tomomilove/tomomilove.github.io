# In the Time of Ixora Rubiaceae

_For Tomomi, who wishes to fly_


## Prologue: Revolution

“The king is dead! The king is dead! Long live the people! The king is dead!”

A girl named Amaryllis Asparagales was playing in the forest with her friend when she heard a man’s voice shouting, followed by the blaring of a trumpet and the sound of a horse galloping. In a moment, the horse and rider raced right past her, so close she felt a rush of wind, and was buffeted in the face by scattered leaves.

Amaryllis turned to her friend. “Sounds like something important, Ixora! They were headed in the direction of the village, let’s hurry back and see what’s up!” Amaryllis’s friend Ixora nodded (she was never one much for words), and the two ran back through the forest towards their village as fast they could. In her rush, Amaryllis tripped over a rock and fell face first into the ground. Her friend reached down, grabbed her by the hand and pulled her up, and they continued on.

Just after the sun set below the horizon, Amaryllis and her friend arrived back at their village, panting and out of breath. They found a crowd gathered at the village central plaza, consisting of about sixty people, seemingly everyone in the village. The man who had passed them on horseback was addressing the crowd, trumpet still in hand.

Amaryllis pushed her way through to the front of the crowd to get a better look, while her friend stayed back, remaining a step apart from the crowd.

The man with a trumpet was giving a speech. “Great people of this humble village,” he declared, “The man you once called king, the man you onced bowed to in servitude, is dead! The people have seized the reins of state and established a democratic government of equality for all!”

This announcement caused murmuring among the crowd, a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.

The man continued, “It has been decided that all cities, towns, and villages in the realm, however big or small, shall send one representative to the capital to serve in the senate, where they may vote on the laws of the land! Who among you shall rise to this honor?”

There was a silence as the people of the village stared back at him. In a tiny remote forest village like theirs, hardly anyone knew or cared much about the realm’s politics, or had any desire to move to the capital.

But Amaryllis stepped forward. “I shall do it.”

The man looked down at her. “My child, this is adult business, not a game for kids. Run along now.”

“I play at no games,” she said. She looked directly at the man, holding her gaze. “I’m serious. I have the will and the capability to do the job.”

“It’s true!” cried out a voice from the crowd. “Amaryllis is the most responsible girl in the whole village!”

“And the kindest and most thoughtful, too!” said another. “She’s always coming ‘round and helping me with chores around the house! Everyone knows and loves Amaryllis!”

“Hear hear!” echoed a third voice. “She’s so smart and driven too! The rest of us, we just spend our days lazing around, eating and napping. But Amaryllis, she’s always coming up with new ideas to improve the village!”

People continued to speak up, and the crowd was abuzz with excitement, everyone singing the praises of Amaryllis.

“Thank you! Thank you all.” Amaryllis’s voice boomed out, and the crowd quieted. “Your kind words mean a lot to me,” she continued, more softly. “I would be honored to act as your representative. In the spirit of the new democracy, let us put it to vote! All in favor, raise your hand!”

Everyone in the village raised their hand, except Ixora.

“Well now!” The man with a trumpet had a look of surprise plain on his face. “A unanimous vote, remarkable! I do not know who you are,” he said, turning to Amaryllis, “But it is clear you are someone exceptional. I would be honored to escort you to the capital to act as a senator! We leave tomorrow at dawn.”

The crowd cheered and rushed around Amaryllis to congratulate her. Ixora walked off.

That evening the village hosted a feast to celebrate, and Ixora was absent. Amaryllis went to look for her after the party was over. She found Ixora in her usual favorite spot, sitting under a tree overlooking the tiny creek that ran along the edge of the village. Ixora was watching the dancing reflections of light in the dark creek waters, cast from the fireflies that hummed about in the night.

Amaryllis approached Ixora cautiously from behind. She leaned into Ixora’s line of sight, tilting her head. “Hey Ixora, I’ve been looking for you.”

Ixora didn’t turn her gaze from the creek. “Come to ask why I didn’t vote for you or something?”

“I guess yeah,” admitted Amaryllis. “You’re my best friend, and you know me better than anyone else, so I just thought you must have some reason. Do you think I lack the skill set to succeed as a senator? I would like to hear your counsel.”

Ixora sighed. She looked down, then turned her gaze to meet Amaryllis’s. “Nah, nothing that deep.” She smiled sheepishly. “I think I just didn’t want you to leave. My selfishness, that’s all.”

Amaryllis’s face brightened, and she clapped her hands together. “Well! That is no problem at all! You can come with me to the capital, and be my assistant.”

Ixora frowned. “Your assistant? How about no.”

“Why not? It would be a great honor to serve the realm.”

Ixora stood up. “Eh. Shouldn’t you be off preparing for your long and arduous journey tomorrow? It’s already late.” She waved her hand dismissively and turned to walk off.

Amaryllis, somewhat offended, watched her go without responding for a moment. Then she called out, “Good night to you, Ixora!”

“Later!” Ixora called back.

## Chapter 1: The Daily Life of a Sky Pirate

About twenty years later…

One early summer midday, the mercantile airship The Philosophy drifted across the skies above the Republic of Interlunium, heading north towards the capital city. Boundless blue sky stretched out in all directions, and huge fluffy white clouds floated by, carried west by a gentle wind. Down below, fields of green and gold farmland blanketed the earth, crisscrossed by an intricate network of roads and rivers, filled with people. From sky to land to water, the world was brimming with life. Farmers, merchants, clergy, soldiers, and more, each person scrambling about, each trying to get somewhere, each carrying out their own personal dramas, each the protagonists of their own stories…

In the innermost chamber of The Philosophy sat Mr. Paulus, head merchant of the trading company Paulus & Sons’ Tea & Etceteras. He was sitting in his velvet cushioned chair, sipping tea and pretending to do important work for his trading empire. Really though, he was just dreaming of corruption. The past several years had been plagued with constant political upheavals, and with every change in power, there was a chance to get in on the good side of the new government and secure favorable trading grants. Recently, there were rumors going around that a new popular general in the army named Amaryllis might be aiming to overthrow the senate in a matter of months. Paulus was imagining himself getting in on this, and establishing lucrative connections for years to come…

Half asleep while entertaining such thoughts, Paulus was shocked awake by a crashing sound, and his ship lurching. He leapt out of his chair, banging his head against the ceiling, then fumbled to button his coat and rushed out of his room to see what was amiss.

The scene that greeted him on the ship deck made it clear what had happened. A small, rickety airship, sloppily painted a deep crimson red, had crashed into The Philosophy’s starboard broadside. The name The Bougainvillea was written on this ship in cursive gold letters. It was flying a huge, tattered black flag with a blood red flower insignia embroidered on it. A board had been laid between the two ships, and three people had crossed over from The Bougainvillea onto The Philosophy. Paulus knew, They must be pirates! The pirates were addressing The Philosophy’s crew, who had gathered in a group.

The pirate in front spoke in a booming voice: “The name’s Ixora Rubiaceae, dreaded captain of the Blood Blossoms, scourges of the skies and most feared sky pirates in all Interlunium!” She was grinning broadly and holding a wide stance, arms crossed. She wore a striking red captain’s coat, with an elegant cutlass slung across one hip, and a hefty pistol holstered on the other.  “I hate beatin’ around the bush so I’m gonna keep this short,” she barked. “Yer bein’ robbed! Give up yer provisions and yer valuables and you can keep yer sorry lives, that’s the deal and I ain’t got the patience for negotiatin’!” Ixora drew her pistol, cocked it, and pointed it directly at the stunned Paulus, who was still trying to process what was going on.

“Ah-ah…” he stammered, unable to speak.

“Cat got yer tongue?” snarled Ixora. Then her eyes narrowed, and with her free hand she drew her cutlass. “I can make that happen for ye literally, if that be yer wish.”

Paulus remained frozen, so The Philosophy’s first mate, a young man in disheveled clothes, stepped in front of him and bowed deeply. “Please excuse my master, missus,” he said. As he spoke, he kept his eyes closed, while repeatedly bowing. “Let us talk before taking any hasty actions!” He took a deep breath. Ixora eyed him, giving him an unimpressed look. He continued, “We just didn’t know what to say. We were so surprised, since we had never heard of your pirate crew before, so...”

“Ye what now,” snapped Ixora. “We’re the most infamous pirates in all the skies, and don’t forget it. Ye better show proper respect to our name.” 

“I mean, um, perhaps we never heard of you before because, um, you must be a new and rising pirate crew, yes? Yes? And indeed, how courageous is that! Truly you represent the entrepreneurial spirit of our age! Um… uh...” The young man couldn’t figure out how to continue this train of thought, so he decided to change tactics. He got on his knees and bowed his forehead to the deck floor. “Please have mercy on us! We are but a humble tea trading vessel, we carry no treasure that would be worthy of illustrious pirates such as yourselves!”

“Tea, eh…” Ixora turned her head towards her pirate crewmate standing to her right and whispered, “Know anything about this so-called tea, Iyo? That worth anythin’?”

“Bunch of grass water, ain’t it?'' The pirate called Iyo mused. “Tried it once meself in that port town on the west coast we robbed a couple years back. Can’t say it made a good replacement for ale…”

The other pirate, who was standing on Ixora’s left added, “I read that it is indeed quite a valuable commodity these days.” He cleared his throat and continued, “A delicacy from the far off southern lands, favored by the new senatorial class for its subtle and delicate flavor. They say it helps them cultivate a refined, noble air.”

“Thank ye Ian, I’m glad I keep you around for this fancy stuff,” whispered Ixora. She turned her attention back to The Philosophy’s first mate and declared loudly, “Ah... tea! Today we’ll be plundering this treasured delicacy! Hand over a good, ah, fifty percent of yer tea, and add in anything ya got good to eat onboard, and we’ll let ya go nice n’ peacefully. Fair deal, eh?”

Before the first mate could respond, Paulus, who had been quiet this whole time, blurted out, “Preposterous! We will not turn our tea to ruffians like you! You, who don’t even know what tea is!” At this point he had worked himself up into a small fury. “You do know, don’t you, that merchants are protected under the law!” He pulled a neatly folded document from his pocket, opened it, held it out in front of his face, and began to read, “By guarantee of the senate, all trade in the republic shall be supported by the fullest extent of the state’s powers--”

Ixora didn’t say anything but rolled her eyes, and tilted her head to the right at Iyo. In the blink of an eye, Iyo dashed forward, drew her sword, and slashed through the contract, stopping her sword just an inch from Paulus’s throat.

“Look around ye, you oblivious fool,” Ixora said flatly. “We’re the ones with swords here, and we’re the law, eh?”

Paulus, completely cowed, did not seem like he could speak, so the first mate quickly interjected, “W-worry not Mistress Rubiaceae! We shall fetch the tea for you immediately!” He motioned to his crew members to start getting the tea. “Quickly now!”

The crew busied themselves fetching tea and provisions and loading them into the pirate ship, and the first mate carried the shellshocked Paulus back to his room. Since the loading was taking a while, the crew even brought our chairs for the pirates to relax in while they were waiting.

Reclining in his chair, the pirate called Ian took out a sky chart from his overalls pocket and studied it intently, plotting their next course. The pirate called Iyo stared up into the sky and looked for shapes in the clouds. “Beautiful day, ain’t it, boss? Ah, that cloud there looks like a pup I used to have when I was a wee lass. Ya see, there’s his ears and there’s his tail?”

Ixora sighed. “Today ain’t nothin’ special. Just tryin’a survive. At least we got another lot of provisions from this ship, should last us a few more weeks.”

After the loading was finished, the pirates boarded their ship The Bougainvillea and pulled away from The Philosophy. Ixora called out, “Ye best not forget the name of those who robbed ye! The dreaded Blood Blossoms, nastiest in all the realm! Spread the word and tell yer friends, all should fear the flag of the Blood Blossoms!”

On cue, Iyo fired a burst from their ship’s cannon into the air, which exploded into fireworks displaying their flower insignia. Simultaneously, Ian ignited the ship’s engine, rocketing them away through the sky, where they disappeared into a cloud, out of sight.

Back on The Philosophy, Paulus had mustered up his sense of indignation again and was loudly complaining to the first mate that they ought to call the army on the pirates and see justice served. But the first mate just sighed and explained they were long gone by now, and besides, the army was far too busy to deal with a couple of small-time pirates.

## Chapter 2: The Rules of Being a Sky Pirate

One Autumn evening, Ixora, Iyo, and Ian squatted together on the deck of The Bougainvillea as it coasted silently across the night sky, carried north by a light wind. To keep a low profile, all of the ship’s lamps were off, with the only sources of light being a small lantern sitting on the floor between them, and the sea of stars above them, and the full face of the shining moon.

“Tell me again, Iyo, what’s the first rule of bein’ a Blood Blossom sky pirate?” Ixora’s arms were crossed, and she had an unamused expression on her face.

“No hurtin’ people. We’re supposed to do fear and intimidation, but no actual violence. I know, boss, I know.” Iyo grumbled and prodded at the floor with her finger. “It’s just that, I got so bored selling all that tea. Felt like I had to break somethin’ afterwards, ya know?” Iyo flashed Ixora an embarrassed smile.

Ixora shook her head. “Listen, Iyo. We may be thieves, swindlers, liars, rule breakers, and rotten no good opportunists, but we don’t sink to violence. We soar above that. We’re all about the freedom of the skies, flying unburdened wherever we please, and we don’t want to take that away from others, either.”

“Aye boss, I remember it just so. The feeling of wind in yer hair, and havin’ no cares in the world… ‘Tis a precious feeling...” Iyo trailed off and was silent. Then gave a sheepish laugh and said, “Aight boss, I’m sorry. Ya know, you can be real persuasive sometimes. No wonder we elected ya cap’n this year.”

Ixora nodded. “Good good. Now that’s taken care of, let’s discuss business.”

“Roger that, captain,” said Ian. He pulled out a notebook from his pocket and flipped through it. “I regret to announce we have already blown through all the money from the tea sales…”

“Already? Dang,” said Ixora.

“Time for another raid then!” Iyo piped up.

Ian agreed. “Indeed. Might I suggest we rob the nearby St. Marcella’s monastery? It is one of the most prestigious institutions of learning in the realm. Rumor has it, it is veritably filled with ancient treasure, art pieces, and forbidden books, a little something for every corner of the market. Not to mention, there should be no soldiers there, on account of it being a holy place. And to be honest, I have always wanted to visit, myself.”

“Sounds good to me,” said Ixora, and the pirates charted a course for the monastery.

Before long, the silhouettes of the jagged, ancient mountains marking the northern border of Interlunium came into view on the horizon, backed by the light of the full moon. As they drew closer, the pirates could see the outline of St. Marcella’s monastery topping one of the peaks. They could see its massive stone walls and grand tower, once famous for being unassailable, now easily flown over by modern airships.

Ixora guided The Bougainvillea towards the top of the tower, only slightly crashing it into the wall and dislodging a few stones. The pirates disembarked on the tower.

Down and down they went, descending the spiral staircase of the tower, before exiting into the central hall of the monastery. While the exterior of St. Marcella’s was rough, crudely hewn grey stone, the pirates were surprised to discover the interior walls were a smooth, deep, iridescent blue, flecked with gold, almost like gazing into a night sky of stars. The floor was covered in a lush, maroon carpet, intricately patterned with gold and black designs of plants and animals. Varnished mahogany desks and deep green velvet cushioned chairs were neatly arranged about the hall. Scholars and clergy sat at the desks poring over ancient texts, furiously scribbling notes, or talking in hushed but impassioned discussion circles.

Upon seeing the pirates, the monastery residents stopped what they were doing and stared. The pirates stared back. Then Iyo drew her sword. Immediately, the residents upped and fled out of the hall, clutching their books and writings to their chests, and nearly tripping over their robes, as they went.

“How rude, didn’t even get a chance to introduce meself,” Ixora scoffed.

Iyo put her free hand on her hip and gazed around the empty hall. There were a dozen passageways leading out of it, and a staircase descending further. “Crikey, this place is huge. Don’t even know what to look for.”

“How about we split up?” Ian pulled his notebook and read over some of his notes. “There are some things I wanted to look into in the eastern wing. Another one of us can check the western wing, and perhaps the last can check the basement.”

“Don’t forget the second rule of bein’ a Blood Blossom sky pirate,” said Ixora. “We need to let them know who we are and why we’re here. Since our work relies on intimidation, we need to establish a reputation. And we’re still small now, hardly anyone knows us.”

Iyo smiled and pumped her fist. “Gotta build that brand, yo! Leave it to me boss!” And she charged out the hall, chasing after the fled scholars and clergy.

Ixora watched her go, then looked at Ian and shrugged. “Guess I’ll head to the basement, see what I can find.”

Ixora descended the stairs, leading to a narrow, low-ceilinged, dimly lit stone hallway. As she traversed it, it twisted, turned, forked, and doubled-back upon itself like a labyrinth. At one point Ixora was sure she had returned to the same location three times. But she figured that if someone had designed it to be this confusing, there must be something valuable at the end, so she pressed on, resolving to pay more attention to the direction she was traveling.

Eventually, one of the hallways gradually widened and opened up, ending in massive double wooden doors, twenty feet tall. They were carved with a mural depicting people, animals, fairies, shrubbery, trees, and the heavens, with a full moon in the sky. A particularly large boar on the mural caught her attention. Ixora thought the scene looked vaguely like a mythological or religious story, but she didn’t know the details. Still, it certainly appeared to be an important place. Struggling, she heaved the doors open, and stepped inside.

A small library opened before her. All four walls were covered in books from floor to ceiling. The floor had books in it too: there were wooden panels on the floor with little switches, and if you pressed a switch, a bookshelf would pop up from the floor -- she could see a few of them were in use. Ixora could even see books slotted into the ceiling itself, although she could only wonder at how you were supposed to get at them.

At the end of the room, there was a small carpeted area, with a low table, a lamp, and a chair. There sat a woman, a mug of coffee in one hand, hunched over a book. Ixora approached and could see the book looked especially ancient, and appeared written in a language she didn’t recognize.

Ixora casually drew her cutlass and walked right up to the table. “Whatcha readin’ there, miss?”

The woman looked up slowly and met Ixora’s gaze. Ixora could see the woman was much older than her, perhaps over sixty years old, with a calm and grave air about her. She was dressed in deep magenta silken robes, which were simple in design but clearly exquisite in quality.

The woman studied Ixora’s face and responded, more talking to herself than addressing Ixora, “Ah, I thought I felt some commotion above, you must be the source.” She looked briefly at Ixora’s cutlass, then returned her gaze down, back to studying her book.

“Answer the question, if ye value yer life! What’s that book? Rare and valuable, eh?” Ixora held out her cutlass, pointing it directly above the woman’s head.

The woman raised her hand, gently brushed Ixora’s blade aside, and looked up. “Be quiet and leave me be.” She returned to her book, jotted some notes in the margin, and turned the page.

“Oi, oi!” said Ixora. “That’s no way to talk to Ixora Rubiaceae, dread sky pirate extraordinaire! Hand over that there valuable book, an’ we can part ways as friends!” She drew her pistol, tossed it up in the air spinning, then spun around, caught it and pointed it at the woman.

The woman, not bothering to look up, responded, “No.”

Ixora waved her pistol up and down. “Excuse me? I’m the one with the gun here missy, ye do what I say or I shoot you.”

The woman let out a heavy sigh, closed her book, then leaned far back in her chair and kicked her feet up on the table. She held her arms behind her head, and looked Ixora directly in the eye. “I doubt you would shoot me,” she said.

Ixora wasn’t sure what to say. “And how do you figure that? That a risk yer willing to take for some book?” But her voice stammered, this conversation was going off routine now.

The woman just shook her head, a sad and distant look in her eyes, as if she were thinking of some other time. “Your eyes are too kind, girl,” the woman said. She stood up from her chair, and before Ixora could react, reached out, grabbed her by the frilled neck of her coat, and lifted her off the ground. After a moment of Ixora kicking about helplessly, the woman lowered her to the ground.

“H-hey…!” Ixora began, but the woman cut her off.

“You can wave those weapons around like a child all you want. I have seen worse.”

Ixora furrowed her brow, trying to think of a response. Then the woman flashed a devilish smile. “Luckily for you, you are amusing me. I will humor you. Tell me, O terrible pirate, what is the most valuable thing in this room? You are here to steal valuable things, are you not? So, what should you take?”

Ixora didn’t answer immediately, because it sounded like a trick question. So, although annoyed at being toyed with, Ixora cast her gaze around the room, examining it more closely. There were basically just books everywhere, but how could she possibly know how much each of them might be worth? They all looked the same to her. Otherwise, there was the richly ornate carpet on the floor, the intricately carved table and chair, and the lamp. It all looked old and valuable to some extent, but exactly how much was hard to say. She really had no idea.

“That book looks pretty valuable…?” ventured Ixora.

“And that is why I am not afraid of you,” concluded the woman. “Because you are an idiot.”

Ixora practically shriveled in her skin, and cast her eyes down. “Look, I dunno much about art and books and whatnot. I’ve been struggling just to get by, you know.”

“As have I,” said the woman. “Do you know who I am? I am Fredericka of the Full Moon.”

Ixora looked at her blankly.

The woman sighed, “Oh gods, you do not even know that? Fredericka of the Full Moon, the crown princess of the Kingdom of Interlunium? The last surviving member of the royal family that ruled Interlunium for 781 years, before it was deposed by the revolution twenty years ago? Does that ring a bell?”

“I… I don’t know much about history or politics,” mumbled Ixora. She put her hands behind her back, and gave a little kick with her foot, embarrassed.

“Clearly,” said Fredericka. “You know, if you captured me, you could make a bid for the throne of Interlunium. You could start a counter revolution to restore the monarchy, and compel me to name you heir to the throne. You could become queen of the realm. That is why I am the most valuable thing in this room, not some ragged old book.”

Ixora considered this. “I’ve no interest in becomin’ a queen,” she said. But she was curious now. “So what’re ye doing here anyway? Princess and all that, reading books in the basement o’ some monastery?”

“Well, after my entire family was murdered in the revolution, I only barely managed to escape, and sought refuge here. Since then I have been in hiding, passing the time reading books. I cannot exactly go outside. If I were to leave, I would most certainly be executed by the republic’s army.”

“Sounds mighty dreadful,” said Ixora.

“Dreadfully boring,” agreed Fredericka. “Wasting away my time, caged inside this monastery.”

“Then...” Ixora cracked a smile, “How about comin’ along with me, and becomin’ a sky pirate? You’d be perfect for it.”

Fredericka tilted her head, giving Ixora a quizzical look. “Perfect? How so?”

“My crew are the Blood Blossoms, we fly free wherever we please, and we certainly ain’t afraid of no army. It’s a life of crime, aye, and it ain’t always easy. That’s why we have this rule: What’s past is passed. All members of the Blood Blossoms must renounce all family ties, all history, and start anew. That way yer family don’t get mixed up in yer pirate business. Anyways, ye already have no family, and it sounds to me like yer history’s doing you more harm than good. So yer all ready to be a pirate, I’d say.”

Fredericka almost laughed, a bemused look on her face. But then she thought about it a bit more seriously, and said, “Flying free as a pirate… a rather aimless, loveless life, is it not?”

“Better than sittin’ around anyway.”

“Indeed.” Fredericka closed her eyes and thought it over, convincing herself. “Well, I suppose I have nothing to lose. I shall join your pirate crew, and see what happens.”

“Welcome aboard, mate. By the way, sounds like yer gonna want to go by a new name. How ‘bout…” Ixora thought for a moment. “How ‘bout Izobel?”

The woman now called Izobel grinned. “I like it.”

## Chapter 3: Siege at Port Town

The flying city Brave Darjeelinum is world famous as a marvel of technology and innovation. It is kept aloft by a multitudinous array of propellers and thrusters, powered by a massive engine complex underneath the city that is nearly as large as the city itself. Taking advantage of its flight capability, Brave Darjeelinum migrates seasonally across the realm to be at different hotspots of production and trade, allowing it to rise as one of the most prominent port cities in Interlunium. Every day, hundreds of airships from across Interlunium and even other nations dock at the city's walls, hoping to partake in the wealth of the republic.

It was a bright and clear summer day, and a cool breeze was blowing. Brave Darjeelinum was positioned near the southern border of Interlunium, engaging in silk trade with the equatorial nations to the south. Ixora and the Blood Blossoms were spending the afternoon in the city taking it easy, relaxing in a cafe run by their primary merchant contact in Brave Darjeelinum, a man who everyone called Mister Marius.

He was a merchant of the black market, of course, a man who asked no questions and was willing to deal with anyone, including pirates. As a cover, Mister Marius ran Whole Milk Cafe, which, as the name implies, is a cafe that serves milk, prepared in a variety of creative ways. Mister Marius was very proud of this venture, he was always bragging that it sounded so wholesome, none of the authorities could possibly find reason to arrest him for it. Still, here in the low neighborhood of Brave Darjeelinum, the true occupation of Mister Marius was an open secret, and not many seemed to mind. He was a man that the townspeople knew they could ask for whatever they needed, be it forbidden medicines, foreign spices, or weapons. He could always get it to them eventually, for the right price anyway.

Ixora slammed her mug of hot chocolate down on the table. “So what’ll it be ol’ Marius? Gonna buy these books or what? My mate Izobel here can tell ye all about ‘em.”

There were about a dozen ancient books from St. Marcella’s on the table between them. “A collection of source writings of eminent priests from two hundred years ago. Before the age of printers, of course, so they are truly one of a kind. I have read them myself and I can personally assure you they are fascinating.” Izobel stirred her milk coffee and gave her best salesperson’s smile at Mister Marius.

Marius took a sip of his steamed milk, wiped off the condensation from his glasses, and took a closer look at the books. “Oh deary me.” His eyes were wide, nearly bulging out of their sockets. “Oh ho ho. You’ve outdone yourself this time, Ixora my girl. I can’t imagine where you found treasure like this, but I daren’t ask, of course. I believe they will be an excellent addition to my collection. Perhaps I will even sell one or two. Yes indeed.”

“And you’ll take the remainder of our tea too, yeah? It goes surprisingly well with this milk I must say,” added Iyo. She chugged the remainder of her glass of milk tea and flashed a thumbs up.

“Indeed it does, Iyo, indeed it does! I daresay it could be a new hit,” agreed Mister Marius. “Perhaps one day it’ll propel my little milk cafe into the roaring success it deserves to be! And what a glorious day it will be.” He closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair, dreaming of milk cafe days.

“I have taken the liberty of preparing a list of what we desire in exchange for the books.” Ian handed a list to Mister Marious, while taking a sip from his iced cocoa. “It contains all the foodstuffs I need to restock our pantries, as well as all the materials necessary for the repairs I have to do to cover up our captain’s graceful piloting job.”

“Hey!” protested Ixora. “Crashing into that merchant ship was totally intentional. It gave them a right scare, didn’t it?” The others laughed, and in this way the afternoon passed in peace, the pirates negotiating with Mister Marius, and sharing stories of their recent adventures. When Ixora lost interest in the conversation, she looked out the window, watching people pass by, so many of them coming and going, to who knows where.

Towards the end of the afternoon, as the sun was beginning to set and the pirates were starting to doze off, suddenly a loud horn sound blared out. Then, the sky went black. The pirates sat straight up in their chairs in surprise.

Mister Marius chuckled at their discomfort. “Oh ho, the city’s protective shell has gone up, covering the sky. It’s just the emergency defense system, nothing to worry about.”

“That… doesn’t sound like nothing to worry about,” said Ixora.

“Aw, who cares? The authorities never took me down before, and I doubt the city being under attack will be any worse.” Still chuckling to himself, Mister Marius got up, and carried the books off to the back room of the cafe. 

The pirates waited in silence as the siren continued, then eventually shut off. However the shell remained up. Ixora stood up from her seat and went out to the street to see what was going on.

Outside, she listened in on the conversations of people passing by in the street, some hurried, others calm. From what she picked up on, it sounded like the city was under siege by some army. But surprisingly enough, it was apparently one of the republic’s own armies. It was unclear why the government would put its own city under siege. But it sounded like they wanted to occupy the city, and the city wasn’t having it.

Ixora returned to Whole Milk Cafe and addressed her crew and Mister Marius. “We Blood Blossoms gotta get out now. No profit being stuck in a besieged city. Nice doin’ business with ye ol’ Marius, we’ll take the agreed upon goods and skedaddle.”

Mister Marius shook his head. “I hate to break it to you my girl, but there’s no getting out of the city now. With our wee little defensive shell up, the city’s on lockdown. All the ports are shut, no ships allowed in or out.”

But Ixora just smiled. “What, did ye think The Bougainvillea was sittin’ at the public docks? Nay, we’re moored underneath the city, down below the city engines. We can get out lickity split. And I’m no slouch at outrunnin’ army ships.”

“You don’t say. Ho ho, you pirates are a crafty bunch aren’t you?” Marius pressed his palms together and leaned in. “Well in that case, I have a request. Can you ferry some things in for me from the outside? I expect certain commodities to become very valuable if this siege ends up lasting a while. I’ll make it worth your while.” Mister Marious held out his palm low under the table, and gave a little shake, and a gold coin slid out from his sleeve into his hand.

The gold glinted in Ixora’s eyes. “I like the sound o’ that. What say ye, Blood Blossoms?” They all nodded their enthusiastic consent.

Mister Marious continued. “Bringing in jugs of fresh water is the top priority, it’ll be worth its weight in gold soon enough. Foodstuffs as well, particularly the preserved kind.”

“Roger that. Blood Blossoms, out!”

Ixora and her crew made their way along the dark city streets. They drew a lot of attention as they barged their way through the townspeople, many of whom were just standing about outside aimlessly in worry. The pirates turned off the main street and made their way down a series of twisting alleyways and stairs, delving deeper towards the city engine.

The further down they went, the narrower and dingier the streets were, and the more sparse the crowds became, until they were mostly alone. Gradually, the passed from the city streets into the city’s engine proper, and they were surrounded by gas, pistons, gears, pulleys and other mechanisms, all whirring incessantly to keep the propellers turning and the city aloft. There was no proper road to follow anymore. The pirates made their way along service walkways and down utility ladders, with nothing but the open air below them. Finally they emerged at the bottom edge of the engine, where a long catwalk extended out into the sky, at the end of which The Bougainvillea lay moored, waiting for them.

“Look sharp everyone,” said Ixora. “First things first, we hafta break through the army ship line, word is they’ve surrounded the city. Iyo, prepare the smoke bombs to mask our escape. Ian, get ready to overclock our engine for maximum speed, I’m sure ye can repair it later. Izobel, yer job is to man the periscope and telescope to keep an eye out for army ships, should be easy enough for a newbie, eh?”

Izobel crossed her arms. “Sounds boring. I would rather try my hand at piloting the ship. I do believe you promised me that the life of a sky pirate would be flying free rather than hiding from the army, and I am inclined to try it literally.”

“Fair enough, the wheel’s yours. Now -- everyone in position!”

The pirates assumed their roles and The Bougainvillea launched away from the dock. For a moment, nothing but a clear blue sky stretched before them, and Izobel steered the ship in a graceful arc away from the city. Then Ixora, who was at the telescope, called out, “Army ship approaching slowly at 9 o’clock. And another stationed at 4 o’clock.” Izobel made a slight adjustment, heading directly between them.

A loud voice boomed from a megaphone on the 9 o’clock army ship: “Halt for inspection! The city of Brave Darjeelinum is under lockdown by the orders of General Tertius of the Republic of Interlunium! No vessels are to enter or leave the city without permission!”

Ixora turned away from the telescope to face her crew. “That’s our cue!”

Ian slammed a lever on the engine and it roared into a frenzy, sending The Bougainvillea rocketing forward at top speed. At this, the army ship picked up its pace heading towards them, and launched four smaller, lighter, faster ships to pursue. The other ship at 4 o’clock had noticed as well and launched four of its own ships. As they began to close in, Iyo fired the smoke bombs from the cannons on boths sides of the ship, creating a thick grey cloud all around them. The pursuing ships plunged into the cloud, but Izobel pulled a sharp dive to the right, evading them, then swung back up to the left, completely shaking them off the target.

“Woooohoooo!!” Izobel let out a cry as they raced through the smoke. For a moment, they could see nothing but grey all around them, and just had to hope they had shaken the army ships. They emerged from the opposite side of the cloud, the blue sky once again open to them, and Ixora looked back to confirm the pursuing ships were behind them. Ian gave the engine one last kick, spinning it into overdrive as the ship barrelled straight away to the horizon.

The army gave up pursuit now that they had broken through the blockade ring. Ixora broke out some milk and snacks that Mister Marius had given them to celebrate. “Cheers everyone! How easy was that? The army don’t stand a chance against the Blood Blossoms!”

From then on it was smooth sailing. Over the course of a few days, the pirates made their way to a nearby trading post, procured several crates of supplies, and snuck back through the army blockade into Brave Darjeelinum. They carried the crates back up through the city engine up towards Mister Marius’s milk cafe, and as they emerged from the engine up onto the city streets, they were swarmed by townspeople, eager to get at the supplies.

“Oi, oi, one at a time! One at a time!” Iyo yelled as she tried to swat them away by waving her sword around. Meanwhile Ixora ran to get Mister Marius for help with the distribution.

Mister Marius laughed as he approached the pirates, who were attempting to reason with the crowd, and failing miserably at it. “My humblest apologies!” he called out. “The city was ill-prepared for a siege and certain items are already running low after a few days. In fact, with no indication of this ending anytime soon, I have to request you make another trip. Worry not, you will be paid handsomely...” And Ixora caught sight of a glint of gold in his hand once more.

And so it was. Ixora and her crew made repeated excursions out of the city to fetch supplies. Each time they returned, the crowd that greeted them was bigger and bigger. “It’s Ixora and the Blood Blossoms!” “Thank the skies for the pirates!” “They’ll show General Tertius who’s boss!” The people cried. As the weeks passed, the pirates even started receiving requests from individuals to deliver mail or procure specialty items.

One afternoon, while the pirates were relaxing at the milk cafe after a hard day’s work, turning over pieces of Mister Marius’s gold in their hands, a woman from the city guard rushed in. She stood at attention and gave a quick bow. “Mistress Rubiaceae! An emissary from the army wants to meet with you to discuss terms of the siege!” she said.

Ixora sat up straight and leaned forward in her chair. “Meet with me? I ain’t no representative for this city. And I’m not one for meetin’s either. That’s a no.”

“M’lady, the army insists, as they believe you are the one responsible for the city being able to hold out the siege for so long. They already tried talking with the city government, but the city claims to have no power over your actions…”

Ixora frowned. “True enough I suppose. Eh, fine then! But on condition that we meet aboard The Bougainvillea. ‘Ts the only place I feel comfortable enough.”

“Very well, I shall relay your request! Let us hope for a swift and peaceful resolution to this crisis!” The guard bowed and rushed out.

Several hours later, a lone army emissary arrived at The Bougainvillea. They met in the captain’s quarters, with Ixora, Ian, and Izobel all sitting around a table, and the emissary on the far end. Ixora was reclining deep in her captain’s chair, spinning her pistol absent-mindedly with one hand, not saying anything, waiting for the emissary to begin.

“Eh, eh hem…” began the emissary, glancing across each of the pirate’s faces.

“If ye came to speak then speak,” said Ixora, without turning her head to meet the emissary, still lazily watching her spinning pistol.

“Um, by official order of General Tertius of the Republic of Interlunium, we humbly request that you and your pirates stop entering and exiting the city illicitly. All ships are to dock at the city’s official ports, which have been taken under control of General Tertius, and are required to--”

“Don’t care,” said Ixora, cutting him off.

The emissary squirmed in his seat. There followed an uncomfortable silence.

“You do realize what situation you’re in, yes?” said Izobel quietly, facing the emissary. “We’re pirates, the law holds no sway over us. We’re getting rich off this siege. If you came to seriously negotiate, then give us an incentive to do something different.”

“You cannot be seriously suggesting that we pay you to stop. Why, that would delegitimize the rule of law, and--”

Ixora gave a loud yawn and leaned back further in her chair with her eyes closed, feigning sleep.

The emissary continued, “Fine, if you want a real reason I will give you one. The army must occupy this city as a matter of national security. The very survival of the republic may be a stake, and you pirates only care about the money lining your own pockets? Have you no shame?”

Ixora continued her pretend nap. So Izobel responded, “The survival of the republic? Whatever do you mean? I seem to recall we are in a time of peace, we are not at war with anyone.”

The emissary paused, considering how much more he should say. But given that Izobel seemed to be engaging with him at least, he decided to continue. “We have received word that another one of the republic’s own generals, General Amaryllis, is returning from a successful campaign against the southern nations, and intends to march her army all the way to the capital to stage a coup to install herself as emperor. Our commander, General Tertius, intends to make a stand here to stop her. He will become known as a great hero, and perhaps you can be a part of that story.”

At the mention of the name ‘Amaryllis’, Ixora’s interest was piqued, and she opened one eye, listening to the emissary. When he finished, she sat up and leaned forward, her elbows resting on the table.

“Look,” she said. “We don’t care about the petty squabbles of army generals. Negotiations are over, get out.”

“Very well then,” said the emissary. “In that case, I have my orders.” In a flash he drew a pistol from his coat and aimed at Ixora. But then Iyo, who had been hiding in the shadows, tackled him, and as he fired a shot it completely missed. Ixora walked over and looked down at him as Iyo kept him pinned to the ground.

Ixora shook her head. “Don’t try to outdo pirates at treachery, eh? Now as I said, get out.” She disarmed him and then sent him on his way.

After the emissary left, the pirates conferred around the table.

“It’s clear we’re targets now, and we won’t be able to survive if the whole army gets after us,” observed Izobel.

Ixora nodded. “So let’s do something. Give them a little payback, then get out o’ this place. I’m getting tired of bein’ a delivery girl, anyway.”

“Hear hear!” said Iyo. “What’s the payback you had in mind, boss? I’m up for that!”

“No idea.” Ixora shrugged. “Anyone?”

“If I may,” Ian interjected, raising his voice. “I have a passing familiarity with the construction of the army’s airships. I do believe I could engineer a way to cut their flight and send them to the ground... gently of course. It would foil their siege completely.”

“Go on,” said Ixora.

“You see, to maintain the siege, the army keeps their ships constantly in flight around the city,” began Ian. “As you may imagine, it requires copious amounts of fuel. It appears the ships refuel at the ports on the outer walls of the city every day. A fuel source that we could easily sneak our way to. I can mix a special substance into the oil that causes it to thicken. That way, the oil will jam all the engines, causing them to fail.”

Ixora gave him a surprised look. “You’re a devious one, ain’t ya?” 

“Ahaha, well…”

“Glad to have ye on our crew. Now let’s carry out this plan and be outta here!” 

That night, the pirates sabotaged the oil, then made their escape on The Bougainvillea. They didn’t stick around to see the results of their plot, but reports from the city indicate the army ships suddenly found themselves falling to the ground, and that the siege was broken.

## Chapter 4: Rivalries


It was an early winter morning aboard The Bougainvillea, and a cold wind was blowing east. After their adventures in Brave Darjeelinum, the Blood Blossoms actually had some excess money for once, and were plotting how best to spend it. They were gathered for breakfast around their low table, enjoying Ian’s precisely prepared hot chocolate.

Ixora had an idea. “Since yer a new pirate, Izobel, we definitely gotta take ye on a trip to Ceyloner, the city of pirates, a real pirates’ paradise!”

Izobel smiled in her good-natured way. “A city of pirates? Sounds exciting,” she said.

“Um,” interjected Iyo, “Do we have to go, boss? I’m, uh... kinda busy?”

Ixora gave her a look. “Busy? Ye ain’t busy, you do nothin’ but travel around with us on this ship after all. Sounds like an excuse to me.”

“Aw, yer right boss. Truth is... I, uh, got kinda a bad rep in there Ceyloner, so I been tryin’ to avoid the place.” Iyo lowered her eyes, giving Ixora a sheepish look. “What’s that thing ya always say? ‘What’s passed is passed.’ So I kinda just wanna like, pass it by, yeah?”

“A bad rep? Look, whatever it was, yer a Blood Blossom now, don’t worry about it. Come on now, chin up.” Ixora gave her a pat on the back.

Iyo relented, “Aye aye, boss.” And so it was that the Blood Blossoms charted a course to Ceyloner.

The hidden pirate city of Ceyloner is tucked away in the mountains on the wetern edge of Interlunium. Ceyloner is built inside a deep cave that cuts into the sheer edge of one of the mountains, at a high frigid snowy altitude, completely inaccessible except by airship. A perfect place to hide a den of pirates who do not recognize the authority of the Interlunian government.

Few people live in Ceyloner permanently. Most pirates come and go as they please throughout the year, stopping in briefly to hide from authorities, swap stories with old friends, trade treasure, or settle scores with rivals. The pirates of Ceyloner are a diverse group, containing people from all walks of life that have fallen into piracy for one reason or another. There is no official order among pirates, but they tend to organize themselves into small bands that vie with each other for fame and prestige among the other groups.

After a day’s journey, Ixora and her crew arrived at Ceyloner, docking their ship at the end of one of the long wooden piers that jutted out from the mountain side into the sky. It was blizzarding all around them, and they could hardly see a few feet down the pier through the wind and snow. Shivering, they hurried into the cave, into the city proper.

Once inside, they were greeted by a rush of warmth. They were in a lively market street lined with shops, restaurants, and bars. The streets were adorned with eccentric collections of red, orange, and gold decorations: ribbons, signs, statues, and lights. Each shop displayed its own unique style, trying to outdo its neighbor. Multitudes of colorful lanterns hung everywhere, providing light in the cave, and bonfires were set up on every block for people to gather around for heat. Everywhere around them, pirates could be seen eating, talking, reveling, and generally enjoying themselves.

Ixora stopped, took a deep breath and looked around in satisfaction. “Ah, can ye smell the spices and cooking brought in from all over the world? It’s good to be back, feels like home. Follow me everyone, I’ll show you to my favorite spot. A game parlour just down the road.”

Izobel said nothing, but her mind was racing with excitement as they made their way down the street. She marveled at the treasures on display in the shops, shimmering golden vases, bejeweled statues, necklaces, silks, and more. Her mouth watered as they passed restaurants preparing all manners of foods, including steamed noodles, gyros of lambs, and grilled fruits, many of which she had only read about in books before. Gazing down an alleyway, she saw a brawl breaking out between some pirates, and looked on with curiosity. Down another, she saw a group of pirates sitting, huddled around a game of some sort, making bets, and joking with one another. In all her sixty-five years, she had never seen such a variety of sights and sounds and smells packed into one place.

Before long they arrived at their destination, a dimly lit hole-in-the-wall kind of bar, tucked down a side street. Entering, there were rickety tables set up for various card games, with groups of pirates sitting around them, playing and eating and drinking. “Let’s find an empty table!” said Ixora, and she led her crew into the parlor.

They were wandering about looking for a place to sit, when Iyo felt a rough shove on her shoulder, and was nearly knocked over. “Oi, watch it!” she barked. She raised her fist as she turned to face who had pushed her, then stopped when she saw who it was.

A pirate captain with three crewmates stood before Iyo. “Well look who it is, if it ain’t me old mate,” said the pirate, addressing Iyo. As she spoke there was a sneering sarcastic smile on her face.

“You know this person?” Ixora asked Iyo.

Before Iyo could respond, the pirate answered. “Aye we know each other. I’m Aiana, captain of the Crimson Crows, meanest pirates in all the skies.” As she said this, her three crew mates standing behind here cheered. Then she pointed accusedly at Iyo, “And this lass here, she’s a former crew member o’ mine. Probably the worst crew member I ever had, at that. No common sense, always quick to temper. So dumb she got ‘erself captured during one of our raids. Never saw her again after that. Too ‘shamed to face up to us I reckon.”

Iyo bristled, but Ixora stepped forward. “That so? Well she’s a Blood Blossom now. And us Blood Blossoms got no business with no Crimson Crows. ” She touched Iyo’s shoulder to lead her away.

But Aiana burst out laughing and grabbed Ixora by the collar of her coat, restraining her. “Hold up lassie, yer the Blood Blossoms? I heard all about ya.” Aiana let go of Ixora and gave her a push.

Ixora turned to face her. “Yeah so what?”

“Rumor has it that ya never use violence. What kind of a joke pirate is that! Ya lot sound more like a bunch of wee delicate flowers than pirates.” Aiana’s crewmates let out a mocking laughter.

Ixora just shrugged. Then Iyo interjected, “Well just ‘cause we don’t use violence doesn’t mean we ain’t the baddest pirates in the sky! Why, you shoulda seen us the other day, we gave the Interlunian army a real run around!”

At this point, a crowd of pirates had gathered around them, curious about the fight that seemed to be breaking out.

“Just drop it,” Ixora said to Iyo quietly. “Ain’t worth it.”

But Aiana wasn’t done. “Hah, you lot really are right cowards. Fragile little flowers.”

Iyo pushed Ixora back and stepped forward. “Oi that does it! I ain’t the weakling you once knew, Aiana, and I’ll prove it. On my honor, I challenge you to a duel, tomorrow at dawn. Ya know the place.” The crowd of pirates that had been watching cheered on in excitement.

Pirate duels are a common occurrence at Ceyloner, and always a public spectacle. In fact, there is an arena specially set up for duels that is occupied nearly every morning. The arena is actually a small airship with a platform built on top, set to hover a distance away from Ceyloner’s piers, off the sheer side of the mountain, in the middle of the blizzardy sky, with the ground thousands of feet below. Duelists typically fight with sabers, and the goal is either to kill your opponent outright, or more simply knock them off the platform, sending them falling to their death. Crowds of pirates generally watch from airships that gather around the dueling arena, so they can cheer and jeer at the fight.

“Iyo, ye shouldn’t--” began Ixora, but Iyo cut her off.

“Let me have this, Ixora! This ain’t about you or the Blood Blossoms, this is personal. I gotta teach this Aiana a lesson.”

“Fine by me,” said Aiana. “On my honor, I accept your challenge to duel. But just so ya know, I didn’t become captain of the Crimson Crows for lack of skill with a blade.”

And so it was that the duel was set for the next morning.

That evening, Ixora sparred with Iyo to practice, in a secluded corner of Ceyloner, where a small waterfall ran down the cave wall. Ian and Izobel sat on a mossy rock nearby to watch and enjoy their dinner. The pirates had splurged most of their gold at a fancy noodle restaurant, ordering the complete twelve courses.

Izobel couldn’t take her eyes off the flashing of Ixora and Iyo’s swords as they danced back and forth. “I know you can do it, Iyo!” she said, in between slurping her steaming soup. “That Aiana, she talks big, but she’s a real fool, I bet.”

“Actually,” said Ian. “I made a point of checking on Aiana’s dueling records at the Ceyloner Hall of Fame. Did you know they had a place like that? It was fascinating. Anyway, it appears there are records of Aiana having been engaged in 57 duels. Implying, of course, that she has a 57-0 win record.” Ian took out a parchment record of Ceyloner duels that he had found, and held it aloft.

Iyo gritted her teeth as she deflected a strike from Ixora. “Thank ya Ian, was that supposed to be encouraging?” 

“Err, I just thought providing all the facts could be helpful… Uh, sorry.” Ian put the record back in his pocket and went back to eating his soup.

“Iyo, yer not bad with a sword either,” Ixora said while narrowly dodging a slash from Iyo. “There’s a reason why yer in charge of fighting in our crew, after all.”

“You know it! I’ve been training every day since ya took me in all those years ago! I’ll show Aiana!” With a swift movement, Iyo struck at Ixora and forced her backwards, pinning her against the cave wall. 

Defeated, Ixora sighed, looking up at Iyo. “Just… try not to die, okay? That’s the important part. 57-0 odds are nothing to make light of, not the kind of thing ye’d want to leave to chance.”

After dinner and a few more sparring matches, Iyo went back to The Bougainvillea and went right to sleep. Izobel went out to explore Ceyloner on her own. Ian went into town to spend the remainder of their money on food and supplies. Ixora went out to the pier to observe the dueling arena. She spent a while gazing out into the night, nothing visible through the wind and snow.

The next morning, Iyo and Aiana stood facing each other, sabers drawn, on opposite ends of the dueling arena. The mountain blizzard raged around them, threatening to knock them off the platform just by itself. A large crowd of airships had gathered, pirates sitting on their roofs and cheering on their preferred fighter. Aiana’s crew were particularly enthusiastic, and had spread themselves amongst the crowd to try to drum up support for Aiana. Not many knew who Iyo was, but about half the crowd was rooting for Aiana and about half the crowd wanted Aiana dead, so the sides were relatively even. Izobel, at least, had made a “Go Iyo!” sign and was sitting on the roof of The Bougainvillea, holding it high.

One of the pirates in the crowd fired a gun shot into the air, and the duel was off. Iyo and Aiana walked towards the center of the arena, approaching each other, swords at the ready. Iyo struck out first, but Aiana parried her blow and struck back, which Iyo blocked.

“Weak,” said Aiana, and she unleashed a series of flurried strikes, which Iyo just managed to block one after another. “Ya know, I’ve always hated you for how stupid you are. What kind o’ fool of a pirate gets herself captured by the idiot army.”

Then it was Iyo’s turn to counterattack, and she advanced forward with a series of attacks, pressing Aiana back towards the edge of the arena. “You can bet I hated you too!” Iyo cried, each word emphasized by a strike. “After ya abandoned me to rot in that jail cell. Some crew mate you were!”

Aiana dodged a hit from Iyo and struck back, pushing Iyo back towards the center of the arena. “Yer capture brought shame to my leadership as a captain,” she said. “Woulda been better ya just died there.”

The two continued to trade parries, blocks, and dodges, neither landing a solid hit. They pushed each other back and forth along the arena, neither able to gain a significant advantage, and appeared to be roughly equally skilled. The crowd cheered and booed at each turn.

After knocking Iyo off balance for a second, Aiana paused and made a show of yawning. “Well, it’s been fun, but I’m done playing games now.” Suddenly, she struck at Iyo with such ferocity that even though Iyo blocked it, she was sent recoiling back. Aiana then advanced on Iyo, hammering away at her with such a furor of slashes that Iyo kept getting pushed backwards, and was unable to halt the momentum.

Iyo could feel her heel hit the edge of the arena. “Ah…” she began to say. The crowd was silent, holding their breath for what would happen next. Then Aiana lunged forward and her next strike pushed her off, with Iyo just managing to grab onto the edge.

Aiana looked down at Iyo, a sad mocking look on her face. “Well, ya asked for it,” she said. “I could let ya go… but what kind of an example would that set for me crew, eh? You challenged my strength, and ya gotta pay fer it.” Aiana raised her sword to finish Iyo off.

“Not so fast!!” Ixora leaped onto the arena, her own sword drawn, aiming straight for Aiana’s back.

“What the--” Aiana spun around and blocked Ixora’s blow, then engaged her. “This is a duel of honor! How dare you interfere!”

Ixora and Aiana traded strikes. “I never did care much about honor,” said Ixora, smiling. The crowd went wild, some of them cheering for the newcomer Ixora, others in fury over the intrusion, and some just excited to see something interesting happen.

Ixora and Aiana fought it out in the center of the arena, and although Ixora had confidence and the element of surprise on her side, Aiana was quickly able to overwhelm her. Aiana began pushing Ixora back towards the opposite end of the arena, when all of a sudden, in the midst of blocking a blow from Aiana, Ixora reached into her coat with her free hand and drew out her concealed pistol, and fired it. The bullet flew by Aiana’s head, but she was stunned. Taking advantage of her hesitation, Ixora dashed forward and struck Aiana’s saber out of her hand, sending it flying over the edge, then stabbed with her own blade, stopping it just an inch from Aiana’s chest.

“Well this is a twist, ain’t it?” said Ixora.

“You dirty, backstabbing, cheat--!” cried Aiana, her face an expression of absolute rage. But she didn’t move.

“I’ll take that as a compliment.” Ixora grinned. “The Blood Blossoms are the baddest pirates in all the skies, after all.” The crowd roared with excitement at this turn of events.

Meanwhile, Iyo had pulled herself back onto the arena. Shaking, she slowly walked over to Ixora and Aiana. “Um…” They turned their heads to look at her. Ixora lowered her sword and stepped aside, letting Iyo confront Aiana. “I, uh, I forfeit, I guess. You can consider this yer victory,” she said.

Aiana crossed her arms and turned her head. “Just get out of me sight.”

Ixora and Iyo hopped from the arena to The Bougainvillea, which pulled away from the crowd and headed back out into the open sky.

The rest of the day, the duel was all the pirates of Ceyloner could talk about. Some were calling it an absolute sham, others were just impressed by the sheer audacity. None could agree whether this meant the Blood Blossoms were the baddest pirates of all or not, or even what that meant anymore. But regardless, the names Ixora Rubiaceae and the Blood Blossoms spread, if not as heroes or as villains, then at least as pirates of note.

Aboard The Bougainvillea, the Blood Blossoms gathered at their meal table for a lunch of fried noodles that Ian had procured from Ceyloner the day before.

Iyo sat, not having taken a bite of her lunch. “Ixora… you… I… uh, I mean...”

“Shh,” said Ixora. “What’s past is passed.”

“Ya didn’t have to put yourself on the line for me. Me own stupidity got meself into that situation, after all…”

Ixora sighed, and set her lunch fork down. “Aiana was right, ye really are dumb.”

“Hey…!”

Ixora shrugged and went back to eating her food.

“Perhaps what Ixora is trying to say,” interjected Ian, “Is that no one deserves to die just because they made a foolish decision.”

“Yeah, that,” affirmed Ixora, in the middle of eating.

“And anyway, we’re crew mates, and we look after each other, it doesn’t matter whose fault it is,” added Izobel.

“Aww… everyone, thank you!”

## Chapter 5: Marooned in the Land of the Fallen

### Captain’s log: March 1st

Today started off seeming like just another ordinary day flying aboard The Bougainvillea. As usual, we didn’t have a particular destination in mind. A gentle wind was carrying our ship southwest, and the great central plains of Interlunium stretched below us, so I mustered some optimism that today would be happy. This peace was not to last, however, when around midday I heard the sound of an explosion and smelled smoke coming from the engine room.

In a moment, Ian rushed up to me, stammered something about going to check up on the engine, and then ran off without giving me time to respond. Then he was back, panting and out of breath. He explained that back at that time when he overclocked our engine so we could outrun the army ships at Brave Darjeelinum, it had damaged the engine. He had meant to repair it since then, but had forgotten.

He was very apologetic about the whole thing, the look in his eyes was like he was practically on the verge of tears. I know he takes his job as the ship’s mechanic very seriously, but maybe to an unhealthy degree. Anyway, I didn’t want to hear his apology, I just wanted to know what the ship’s status was. But before I could get any real information out of him, we heard another explosion from the engine room, and the ship suddenly lurched downwards, before stabilizing into a glide.

I remember asking Ian as plainly as I could he thought our best course of action was. He said we should attempt a landing. He informed me that, “fortunately -- or perhaps, unfortunately”, we were in the vicinity of a settlement known as Old Darjeelinum, and could land nearby. I didn’t know what he meant by that, so I pressed him for details. He managed to rattle off a history of the place on the spot. Copied below as well as I can remember: 

About twenty years ago, when the engineers of the great city of Darjeelinum figured out how to lift their city into the sky, allowing it to migrate across the realm to maximize trading profits, the city was given the new name Brave Darjeelinum, celebrating the bravery of those who chose to live in the sky. The land that was left behind, nothing but a sorry crater of muddy earth and some scattered buildings on the rim, was called Old Darjeelinum.

Life in the flying city Brave Darjeelinum was tough at first. There was always the risk that some person of malintent could sabotage the city’s engine, sending the whole city crashing to the ground, and killing everyone. As a result, there was a zero tolerance policy for criminals and other undesirable individuals, and it became customary to banish them to Old Darjeelinum, rather than risk them being kept in the flying city. Over time, Old Darjeelinum became a common site for banishings all across Interlunium. Those who had committed wrongs not bad enough to be imprisoned or executed for were often renounced by their families and communities and sent to Old Darjeelinum, where no one ever heard from them again. It is a place that not even sky pirates visit, as pirates roam the realm as they please on their airships, having no need to be confined to a hole in the ground like Old Darjeelinum.

Ian and I headed to the ship’s wheelhouse and found Izobel there, trying to maintain control. Recently she seems to have taken quite a liking to piloting the ship, I see her at the wheel more often than not.

Izobel made an admirable attempt taking us down gently, but in the middle of our descent there was another explosion, setting fire to the ship. The wings burned, and the ship plummeted downward fast, spiraling out of control. We crashed into the ground and skid, tearing up a trail of earth and mud, before finally coming to a stop.

We were all silent for a moment, before Izobel called out, “We lived! I am calling that a successful emergency landing!”

And honestly? I’m proud of her. She’s never attempted an emergency landing before, and she’s learning new things everyday. It’s funny, she’s older than me, but I think of her like a daughter I guess, the way I have to teach her everything about pirate life. I want to see her succeed.

After we disembarked we checked out the damage on The Bougainvillea, and I have to say, it looks rough. The wings are just gone, the hull is ripped apart where we hit the ground, the engine is totaled, and much of the interior is a wreck. After we saw the damage, Ian kept trying to apologize and Iyo tried to calm him down, bless their hearts.

The location we landed in isn’t welcoming. We’re on the floor of a huge earthen crater seemingly miles wide. The sides of the crater rise sharply in all directions around us, possibly one hundred feet in height, and curve inward at the top, looking impossible to climb. Gazing across the muddy floor of the crater, in the far off distance we can see some tents and shoddy buildings scattered around. That is Old Darjeelinum, though it can hardly be called a town.

A few curious townspeople gathered to observe us and the crash, but as soon as we turned our attention to them, they fled without a word.

Our first thought after the crash was to learn more about the situation. Izobel and I headed towards the town to see if we could speak with the residents. Iyo went walking along the perimeter of the crater to see if there was any way up and out of it. Ian stayed behind to inspect the ship more closely.

The town greeted us with a creepy silence. People supposedly live here but honestly it feels like a ghost town. The roads -- just scattered lines of misshapen stones -- were completely empty of people. Odd pieces of trash and debris blowing by were the only signs of movement. I occasionally glimpsed residents peeking out from their dwellings at us, but they hid when we drew near.

It must have been clear to all the residents that we didn’t belong. I was of course wearing my signature fancy red captain’s coat. It’s meant to have a bold look to be memorable and to strike fear into the hearts of the merchants we rob. But here, maybe it draws too strong of a contrast to the dull, dirty town, built of mud and stones and sticks and raggedy tents. I felt self-conscious. I certainly don’t like the idea of hidden people watching me.

Izobel and I had absolutely no luck discovering anything of note. We gave up once the sun began to set, and headed back to The Bougainvillea. We prepared a campfire outside the wreckage of our ship and swapped stories with the others over dinner. Iyo reported that she could not find any way to climb out of the crater. Ian reported that he would try his best to repair the ship within a few days.

The ship is completely uninhabitable, so it looks like we’re sleeping out in the open tonight. As I write this, I can’t help but turn my eyes upward to the shimmering sea of stars above, so close and yet so far. How I long to fly once more, the only thing that brings me peace.

### Captain’s log: March 2nd

Today Iyo, Izobel, and I spent our time scavenging for food, while Ian stayed behind to work on the ship. It seems like we might be stranded here for a while. Sadly, just prior to the crash we had binged our food stores, so it seems we only have enough left for a few more days.

Unfortunately, we had little luck searching for food. Outside the town, along the edge of the crater, we found some sickly plants growing, with a few questionably colored fruits and vegetables. I’m really not convinced they’re edible, but Iyo was optimistic, so we picked what we could just in case. We searched around town as well, and found some discarded bits of food, but nothing substantial.

We had a curious dilemma though. Izobel suggested that we steal food from the townsfolk, since we are pirates after all, and we live by stealing to survive. For some reason, though, I couldn’t bring myself to do it. The townsfolk here are just so pathetic, it just feels like it would be too easy. I think we should hold off on that unless we get really desperate.

The mood over dinner tonight was sullen. No one bothered to engage in conversation. Everything about this place is just depressing, and I find myself withdrawing in.

### Captain’s log: March 4th

We met a man named Fava while scavenging through town today. A curious fellow. He introduced himself by firing a gun at us from behind (which luckily missed). I drew my own pistol in response but this didn’t seem to faze him at all. He made a motion like removing an imaginary hat from his head and bowing to us, then approached us, smiling and open, as if nothing at all was wrong. He didn’t stop until he was uncomfortably close to me, until my raised pistol was pressing into his chest. I got a look at his eyes and they didn’t seem to be focusing on me, or anywhere really, just staring blankly. Then in an unnaturally slow voice, he just said, “Welcome... welcome to Old Darjeelinum.”

I had a really hard time reading him. His voice had just a hint of sarcasm to it, like he was trying to make a joke or something. Or maybe he was serious, and had lost his sense of how to deal with other people. I wonder if living in a place like this does that to you.

We tried talking to him but he said some stuff that really annoyed me. Like: “I heard you were sky pirates. You must be very lucky indeed to be sent to a place like this. I thought it was army policy to execute pirates on the spot, instead of just exiling them.” And can you believe he laughed while saying this? I clarified that we weren’t sent here in exile, we just crash landed on accident. Then he said, “You are mistaken. All who end up in Old Darjeelinum deserve to be here. Call it fate, or call it karma. If you think back on the series of choices that led your path here, you will inevitably discover, it was your fault all along…”

What nonsense, I certainly don’t believe in anything like that. I wanted to argue with him, but the way he talked with no intonation behind it just really unsettled me, so I held my tongue.

We asked him some basic questions about Old Darjeelinum, like why wouldn’t any other residents talk to us. Here was his explanation: “While this may be a town, it is not a community. There are two types of people here: The first type, so wretchedly ashamed of their own sins, so deeply embarrassed at having been exiled from their homes, cannot bring themselves to face other people. The other type is completely the opposite: so convinced of the fact that they have done nothing wrong and that they do not deserve to be here, that they look down upon the other residents with scorn, and refuse to associate with them. As a result, everyone keeps to themselves.”

Iyo, her usual tactless self, asked him which type he was. He gave a bizarre answer: “I consider myself an unbiased observer, a neutral philosopher. I think and I ponder on the condition of Old Darjeelium, and that is all. You see, on some days I am the one type, and on other days I am the other. I oscillate between them, like a sine wave, thinking, overthinking, on my condition. I cannot help myself.”

That’s great and all, but I really did not care. I felt like I wanted to get the heck out of there. But Izobel, insisting on being polite, talked to him more.

When talking with Izobel, Fava’s entire nature seemed to change drastically. His eyes focused on her, and he began to speak at a normal rate, with intention. To her, he explained that he used to be an officer in the royal army, and after the revolution he continued his post, serving in the republican army. He was sent here about ten years ago following some political scandal. Worryingly, he made an offhand comment that suggested he recognized Izobel. I suppose if he served in the royal army all those years ago, he may have seen the princess around. He didn’t elaborate and we didn’t pursue the topic further either, and thankfully it was dropped.

Then I did something I’m not sure if I’ll regret. We asked him for food and suggested a trade. He wouldn’t take our money though, saying it was “Nothing but fools’ gold in Old Darjeelinum.” Instead, for some inexplicable reason, he fixated on my red captain’s coat, and he wanted that, and only that.

To be honest, I have a bit of an emotional attachment to my coat. In my early days as a pirate, the people I robbed would always remember me by the color red, a symbol of my audacity as a pirate. That’s how the concept of the “Blood Blossoms” was formed: red was our brand, and we would strike blood red fear into the hearts of all.

I agreed to give it up though. It’s just a coat anyway, it can be replaced. If it means food for my crew, it seems a fair trade.

### Captain’s log: March 8th

I think it’s been about a week since we first crashed in Old Darjeelinum. Food remains tight but we are getting by. Ian assures me repairs on the ship are going fine but I can tell he is struggling. It’s already long past the few days he initially said it would take to repair the ship. It seems most of it is done, except the engine. Normally Ian has such a quiet demeanor but increasingly I’ve seen him practically banging on the engine, clearly frustrated. In fact just today I saw him tightening a pipe so hard he snapped it right off. I’m no mechanic, but the engine looks beyond saving, if you ask me. Recently I’ve caught him dozing off in the middle of the day, I think it’s because he stays up all night working, then eventually his body catches up with him. I want to tell him it’s okay, everything is okay, if he’s working so hard because he thinks this is all his fault, he really doesn’t need to worry about it.

### Captain’s log: March 15th

Early this morning, we were surprised by a great shadow being cast over us, and looked up to see a fleet of airships high above Old Darjeelinum. They were heavy warships, about two dozen of them, arranged in a precise grid formation, unmoving. There was a particularly huge white ship at the center front, trimmed with silver, with a magnificent white flower insignia emblazoned on its side.

A thousand thoughts rushed through my head upon seeing this. On the one hand, any sight of civilization was comforting at this point. And airships, too! Perhaps they also provided an opportunity to escape from here, if we could commandeer one of the ships, or maybe stowaway. But on the other hand, it was clearly a legion of the army, and when the army shows up somewhere you don’t expect, it’s never a good sign. What could they possibly want from Old Darjeelinum?

Iyo and I made our way into town to see what was going on, cautious to avoid too much attention. The scene that greeted us was just strange. On the one hand it was like a typical army raid, the soldiers moving about town, stealing all the food, weapons, tools, and other valuables they could find. But what was bizarre about it was that the soldiers moved so calmly and quietly, just walking about like it was the most casual thing in the world. We saw the occasional Old Darjeelium resident try to stop the soldiers, yelling at them, blocking their path, even trying to hit them. But the soldiers gave them absolutely no reaction at all, just walked straight through them without even turning their heads. It was the most uncanny thing, like they didn’t even see them at all.

We decided to seek out Fava to see if he had any explanations or “philosopher’s wisdom” to share with us. He’s a strange one, but I feel some kind of kinship with him. Maybe because he is the only person in this town who has talked to us.

We found him following around a soldier, heckling him, while the soldier paid him absolutely no mind. He was saying things like, “Don’t pretend you don’t recognize me, your old commander!” But the soldier just went about his business.

With some heckling of her own, Iyo was able to break Fava’s fixated attention on the soldier and get him to come talk to us. He told us he recognized this army legion, in fact he used to be a part of it. They were called the Shining Amaryllis, headed by his former boss, General Amaryllis Asparagales. Fava surmised that she must be on her way to the capital to stage a coup and install herself as emperor. Since her army could no longer rely on support from the state, they had to raid towns along the way to resupply. Apparently he had planned such a plot alongside Amaryllis years ago.

Imagine that. My childhood friend Amaryllis, now a general in the army, and perhaps soon to become an emperor. I always knew she was heading for big things. I’m happy for her, really.

That said, it hurts me to watch the residents of Old Darjeelinum let themselves get walked over like this. It looks like the raids will continue for time. If only the residents would put up some organized resistance, I’m sure they could reduce the damage.

### Captain’s log: March 15th (again)

I couldn’t sleep tonight. I was thinking about how Amaryllis might be nearby, and it’s been so long since I last saw her. I thought I would go poking around town on the off chance that I might happen to run into her. Of course it was incredibly unlikely, she was sure to be up in her airship while the foot soldiers continued their raiding work. But I was feeling restless and figured why not.

It was a pitch black night. The moon and stars were covered by clouds, and Old Darjeelinum has no lighting infrastructure, not to mention the fact that it’s situated in a giant hole miles away from the nearest real town. It was that kind of deep primordial darkness that makes you feel like you are in a world untamed by humans. It is no stranger to me though. When I was a child, I would often play in the forest at night by myself, taking comfort in the quiet and in the solitude. I developed a skill at sneaking about confidently and quietly in the dark, a skill that has served me well in piracy.

Making my way towards the town, I became alert to the sound of someone else’s heavy, unsure footsteps, tripping over rocks, breaking branches with loud cracking sounds, and sloshing about in the mud. A soldier perhaps? I crept up on the source of the sound, and when I got close enough to identify the person, I was surprised to find Ian.

I was somewhat amused at his clumsiness and thought to give him a scare, so I gave him a hearty pat on the back from behind and called out his name. He let out a yelp and practically leaped out of his skin. I burst out laughing, but he looked pretty shaken, and took a moment to compose himself, before he was able to talk.

Thinking back on it, It was a bit of an absurd conversation, standing out in the middle of the mud, talking to each other in such darkness we couldn’t even make out each other’s faces. For some reason I felt compelled to confide in him my frustration with the people of Old Darjeelinum, how they wouldn’t talk to us, how they wouldn’t help us, how they wouldn’t stand up against the soldiers, how they seemed to just sit here doing nothing. I thought they could learn something from us pirates.

As I was saying all this, I noticed he was uncomfortable, and acting like he wanted to say something, but couldn’t quite bring himself to do it. So I deliberately slowed down and kind of left pauses to give him opportunities to interrupt.

Finally, he spoke, and said he thought he knew a way to help. Then he told me something he said not to tell the others. He basically told me his whole life’s story. He was the youngest son of a noble family, who once upon a time went to university to study airship engineering. However, in the folly of his youth he committed some unforgivable sin (he wouldn’t tell me what), and was banished to Old Darjeelinum. Apparently he lived here for several years. But he was not content to sit here forever. He worked tirelessly and eventually built himself his own airship, and escaped. But, having been disowned by his family, he had no place to go in the world, and wandered hopelessly, before eventually meeting me and deciding to become a pirate.

Ian told me the townsfolk would recognize him, and they would at least listen to him. He would talk to them tomorrow, on my behalf.

So that is his story. I always wondered how an educated person such as him fell into piracy. But I never asked before, since after all, we have that rule about throwing out your history when you become a pirate. Still, I feel that he learned the wrong lesson from that rule. If he had told us about his familiarity with Old Darjeelinum earlier, instead of hiding it, it could have helped us a lot. Instead we suffered for weeks for his silence. I feel that he actually let his shame get the better of him, and in that sense, he had not truly disowned it.

Anyway, with Ian’s promise of support, here is the plan I am thinking of for tomorrow. We’ll convince the residents to form a mob to obstruct the soldiers from their raid. In the confusion, us pirates will sneak into one of the landed army ships, steal its engine, install it in The Bougainvillea, and fly off. This plan bets on the fact that the soldiers won’t violently retaliate, because I don’t want the townsfolk to spill blood on our behalf. I’m counting on you, Amaryllis. I’m counting on your good nature, and how you always said you wanted to help everyone… don’t let me down.

### Captain’s log: March 16th

I wasn’t sure how Ian planned to get the attention of the townsfolk, but this turned out not to be a problem. As soon as we walked into town, people started approaching him, one-by-one at first, then gradually more, and soon a crowd formed around us.

They were all jeering at him, throwing insults at him, calling him worse names than I’ve even heard pirates speak. It was hard to follow the details, but I caught on that they seemed upset at how he had escaped Old Darjeelinum while they had not, as if he thought he was better than them, as if he thought he deserved to live free. I also gathered that he hadn’t been well-liked back when he lived in Old Darjeelinum either, having been seen as aloof, haughty, and cold.

As the crowd riled up, they even got to throwing rocks. Iyo stepped forward to shield him and tried to fend people off with her sword. But we were completely surrounded by the crowd now. I was getting a little worried, being surrounded by a crowd is kind of a dangerous position, you never know if things could suddenly take a turn for the worse.

But then I heard a booming voice cry out: “Ah, Ixora my friend, hullo!” It was Fava, at the edge of the crowd, a wide grin on his face, his arm stretched high in the air, waving. The crowd paused to consider him. “Don’t worry, they’re friendly!” he told the crowd. “They talked with me!” The crowd calmed, and Fava pushed his way through to us. And I had never been so relieved to see him.

Fava exchanged greetings with us, and I remember what he said to Ian: “So fate brings you back to Old Darjeelinum once more, eh? What a cruel master karma is, is it not?”

And I remember Ian’s response: “I was just on my way out again, actually.”

With Fava’s entrance calming the crowd, I explained my plan to them. We could mob the soldiers, which would help us pirates escape, while putting an end to the raid for the benefit of the townsfolk. I implored them, it was a win-win, a fair trade, was it not?

I didn’t exactly get an explicit answer, but the crowd roared off after the soldiers, so it seemed like they agreed. Us pirates ran off towards one of the army ships, and once it was clear all the soldiers were distracted dealing with the townsfolk, we snuck our way in. Ian expertly disengaged the engine and Iyo carried it back to The Bougainvillea, while Izobel and I took food, supplies, and anything else that looked useful.

Back aboard The Bougainvillea, I remember the sudden roar of the engine as it flared to life. The new engine was clearly too powerful for our little ship, and we rocketed into the air in a jolt. As we climbed higher into the sky, clearing the rim of the Old Darjeelinum crater, I smiled to see Iyo launch our fireworks, exploding into our blood red flower insignia, letting all know that the Blood Blossoms had been here.

## Chapter 6: Treasure over the Horizon

“Rise an’ shine, ‘Xora! It’s a brand new day!”

Ixora groaned, and with her eyes still half-closed, sat up to see Izobel standing at the foot of her bed. “What now, ‘Bel? Can’t it wait until I’ve properly gotten up and all…?”

“Well hurry and get yourself up properly then! I’ll be waiting on the deck with the others!” Izobel skipped out of the room, leaving Ixora to wonder just what had gotten her in such a good mood today.

Ixora exited her room to the deck of The Bougainvillea, and paused to take a deep breath and feel a rushing western wind on her face. She saw Iyo, Ian, and Izobel standing at the ship’s railing, watching the sunrise over the mountains to the east. After a moment taking in the soft blue-pink light of the morning, Ixora walked over to join them.

“There’s something I’ve always wanted to do…” began Izobel, still looking out over the horizon. “When I was a young girl, my mother -- the queen -- would tell me stories of a great treasure known to the royal family that was hidden away in secret. She would say that in a time of great need, I could call upon it to aid me. Well… I never did seek it out. But pirates love a good treasure hunt, right? What say we look for it together?”

“You want it, you got it,” said Ixora. “I’m in.”

“Excellent! Now for the hard part…” Izobel’s voice trailed off.

“Ye don’t know where it is, eh?” Ixora put her hands on her hips and smiled.

“I just have memories of the old stories to go off of, and from what I recall… it is said to be hidden deep within an ancient shrine, in the midst of a dense forest, on a mountain range, that you could watch the sun set behind, from the royal palace……...”

“Implying a mountain range to the west of the royal palace, yes? But there are no mountains to the west,” said Ian. “Interlunium is, of course, famously shaped like a crescent moon, cradled by mountains around the north and east, which turn to wasteland in the south. The center is a bay, and to the west is just the ocean.”

“Yes exactly,” said Izobel. “For that reason, I wonder if the treasure is just a made up story. But still... now I would like to give a serious try to figuring it out. Perhaps there is some explanation.”

The pirates turned their gazes westward and looked out over the land of Interlunium stretching before them, the great plains turning to wetlands before giving way to an unbroken horizon of ocean.

“Say boss,” offered Iyo. “P’rhaps we oughta go ask the ‘Venturer’s Guild. If anyone knows about mysterious mountains I reckon it’d be them.”

“The what now,” asked Ixora.

“The Adventurer’s Guild, ya know.”

“I don’t.”

“Ah. Okay. It’s kinda a new popular thing these days. I’ve been lookin’ into it recently. These people called adventurers, they wander the realm, explorin’ all over, and helping people they come across. And they compile and organize info on all things they discover at a place called the ‘Venturers’ Guild. ‘Tis actually just an airship that hangs out in the middle of the bay typically.”

Ixora nodded at Iyo, impressed. “Sounds as promising as anything. Let’s chart a course.” And so they headed for Interlunium’s great central bay.

Around twilight, as The Bougainvillea glided over the calm waters of the bay, the pirates spotted a tiny light glowing in the distance. Approaching, they could make out that the light was coming from a small airship. It was the Adventurers’ Guild, an immobile-type airship, built primarily for hovering in place, rather than for traveling at great speeds, essentially just a floating building. It looked much like a large house, with a great array of propellers beneath it to keep it afloat, and a few docks jutting out from it. The pirates parked their ship at one of the docks, and made their way inside the building.

The wooden floors of the Adventurers’ Guild creaked under the weight of the pirates’ footsteps as they entered. It was not an old building, but appeared cheaply constructed, and seemed barely able to hold the weight of everything inside. From floor to ceiling the building was packed with stacks of books and scrolls, old maps, all varieties of weapons and armor, scientific measuring instruments, clockwork devices of unclear use, bottles and jars of every color and size imaginable, food and cooking utensils, antique furniture and art, miniature automatons, cages containing strange animals the pirates had never seen before, and countless other wonders.

The pirates made their way along the narrow passageways of free space that winded their way through the piles of stuff, until they arrived at what looked like a front desk. A person was sitting behind the desk, intently writing in a small notebook. Without breaking her concentration, she spoke: “Hello and welcome to the Adventurers’ Guild. My name is Bea and how may I help y--” The woman called Bea looked up from her notebook, and her eyes widened. “--Oh. My gods. You’re the Blood Blossoms, aren’t you?”

“Aye we are.” Ixora crossed her arms. “What, yer afraid we’re gonna rob ye or somethin’?”

“Oh no, it’s just that--” Bea clasped her hands together, “I’m a big fan! I’ve heard so many stories about you, I never thought I’d get to meet you in person!” Bea stood up and held out her hand. “Allow me once again to extend my warmest welcome to the Adventurers’ Guild.”

Ixora skeptically reached out her hand and shook. “Don’t think we did anything to warrant havin’ fans,” she said.

“So what brings you here today?” continued Bea. “No wait -- don’t tell me. You’re not here to register as adventurers, are you? Please say that you are. The guild would become so much more popular if people knew the Blood Blossoms were on board!”

“Sorry to disappoint you, but we’ve just come seeking information,” Izobel cut in.

“Is that so. Well then,” Bea thought for a moment. “Let’s talk over dinner. And you simply must stay the night. You know, one of the many functions of the Adventurers’ Guild is as a hostel of sorts. Humble but comfortable, I assure you! And the view over the bay at dawn is not to be missed. Come now, no need to be shy, I’ll show you to the dining hall. There’s some other adventurers staying here right now too, maybe they can help you.” Without giving them a chance to respond, Bea ushered the pirates through a door into the dining hall.

Immediately they were greeted by the rich smells and sounds of cooking: Ixora could recognize onions, garlic, pepper, bread, cheeses, and more. They could hear the boiling of soup, the sizzling of pans, and the rattling of lids on boiling pots. It looked like the dining hall was composed of a kitchen area on one end, with two cooks hard at work turning out dishes, and a seating area on the other end, with several round tables spread around. A handful of adventurers were seated at the tables, eating, drinking, chatting, or just lazing about. Bea led the pirates over to a table and called over some food.

The pirates told Bea the story of the treasure they were looking for. As they were talking, some of the adventurers pulled up their chairs to listen in and contribute to the conversation. Several of the adventurers mentioned they had heard stories of the Blood Blossoms’ daring exploits in every corner of the realm. The pirates didn’t ask whether they approved of stealing -- adventurers were known to be do-gooders after all -- and the adventurers didn’t bring it up either. They just seemed impressed by the excitement and the danger.

In the midst of this discussion, a seasoned-looking adventurer who had been quiet up until this point spoke up. “So your story’s about some missing mountains, huh? Kinda rings a bell actually. Something I heard a while back. Thought the guy who told it to me was crazy at the time though.”

“Oh? Please, go on,” Izobel implored him. “We’ll hear anything.”

“I guess it must have been forty years ago now. I was trekking through the coastal wetlands in the south. I had stumbled across an old lumberjack’s house and asked to rest there for the night. I helped him with chopping the wood and some other odd jobs, and in return he told me a story about some mountains that were erased.”

“Erased?” asked Izobel.

“Yeah, strange right? But that’s the term he used. See here, I’ll show you just what he showed me.” The adventurer motioned for Bea’s notebook and a pencil, and she handed it over. In it he drew three triangles in a row, representing mountains. Then, he erased the bottom half of the mountains, leaving only the peaks, floating in midair.

Ian looked at the drawing quizzically. “I am not quite sure I get it. You left the peaks there?”

“That’s just how he explained it to me. He said that in the ancient past there was a great calamity, which caused the bottom half of the mountains to disappear, leaving only the tops, unmoving. As if the bottom half of the mountains had merely been erased. I told you, I thought he was crazy, but...”

Everyone considered this for a moment in silence.

“So he didn’t happen to say where they were supposed to be, did he?” asked Izobel, finally.

“Well no. But I guess I just didn’t bother to ask. I wasn’t really taking him seriously, just thought it was a fairytale or something.” The adventurer shrugged.

Iyo jumped up from her chair, excited. “Ooh, speaking of fairytales! It reminds me of a fairytale I heard when I was just a wee lass,” she said. “Do y’all know the stories of Mats-Ela, the land of fairies?” She looked over the faces of her companions at the table, imploringly.

“Yes indeed, I should think all Interlunians know those stories,” Ian explained. “They are popular children’s tales with fairies and talking animals, yes? All teaching some kind of moral for young impressionable minds.”

“Oh yes, of course, I know them too.” Izobel rested her chin on her hand, clearly thinking about something. “You were saying, Iyo?”

“Aye, well, do y’all remember what happens at the end? Most of the stories are nice an’ peaceful for kids and whatnot. But then at the end, it’s said that humans try to enter the land. And the fairies, who are afraid of the humans, erase the land, to protect it from them. And that’s the explanation parents always give for why no one can visit the fairies and the talking animals, since curious children are always asking. Anyway, ‘erased’ sounds kinda similar, right?”

“Fairies, talking animals, erased lands… it all defies scientific explanation,” Ian mused. Now he stood up from his chair. “I am intrigued.”

Izobel also stood up from her chair, excited. “I really think there could be something here,” she said. Then she paused. “But I certainly wouldn’t know where to begin looking for the fairytale land of Mats-Ela.” She paused and looked downcast. Ixora stood up and put her hand on her shoulder.

Now it was Bea’s turn to leap up from the table. “Don’t worry, I’ll check our archives! If it’s a real place, I’m sure an adventurer has stumbled across it at some point. Exploring the land is what we’re all about! There’s bound to be some mention in the logs somewhere!” Bea rushed out of the dining hall before anyone could say anything. Ixora followed her.

Bea and Ixora spent the night poring over books, scrolls, maps, and everything else they could find aboard the Adventurers’ Guild. Bea had called it an ‘archive’, but to Ixora, the piles of stuff just looked like a mess. Still, Bea appeared to know exactly where everything was. Ixora would suggest a time period or geographic location to look into, and Bea would dive straight into the piles of stuff and come out with several related documents.

Hours later, Ixora was sitting on the floor struggling to keep her eyes open (she was never much for books anyway), when she heard Bea cry out, “Eureka!” Ixora jolted awake to see Bea holding a map in the air, in triumph.

Ixora roused herself and groggily walked over. “What ye go there, Bea?”

“Look here Ixora, look!” Bea spread open the map, and pulled Ixora in to look at it. It was a sky chart showing Interlunium, then the sea to the west, and then the continent of Aster across the sea. On the chart was recorded a rough flight path that an adventurer had taken while traveling from Interlunium to Aster. It wasn’t a straight line though. Partway across the sea, the line swerved off course, then spun in circles, before continuing on. At this swerve, there was a small X-marking and a faintly scrawled note: “Unexpected winds blew off course; crash landed on unknown floating islands; repaired ship and continued on”.

“Mysterious floating islands to the west o’ Interlunium, eh? That kinda fits.” Ixora smiled. “Nice one, Bea!” Bea beamed.

It was already past 3 AM at this point, and everyone else had gone to sleep, so they decided to turn in and let them know in the morning.

The next day, the pirates set off towards the location on the map to see what they could find. Bea saw them off and told them if they returned with a report on their discoveries, the Adventurers’ Guild would reward them handsomely. “That’s your job, Ian,” declared Ixora. He seemed amenable.

The spot on the map was hundreds of miles out to sea and would take practically the whole day to get there. The thought of piloting an airship over open ocean for so long made Izobel nervous. There would be nowhere to land if things went wrong, and The Bougainvillea wasn’t built to float on water.

But once they actually got out there, Izobel felt calm. There was nothing but the open sea stretching in all directions around them, a clear blue sky, and the wind rushing by. Izobel thought about how much it was the opposite of her previous life, hiding away in the tiny, cramped library in the basement of a monastery. As the ship coasted on for hours, Ixora, Iyo, and Ian amused themselves by playing card games, telling riddles, practicing fencing and the like, but Izobel was content to stand at the wheel and gaze out to sea.

Night fell, and they were blessed by a sky shimmering with stars, and the full moon shining brightly. Still, The Bougainvillea carried on. They approached the area marked on the map, and a powerful wind whipped up. Izobel called to the others to keep a lookout for anything of interest. It felt like it would be in vain, as it was difficult to see anything in the dark. The pirates debated retreating to rest for the night, and to try again in the morning. Just then, Iyo called out and pointed:

“Ho there! Is that another moon in the sky?”

The others looked and sure enough, they could see another moon, flattened, distorted, and shimmering. Izobel wheeled around The Bougainvillea in its direction, and they headed to inspect it. As they got closer, they could see around it a mass of darkness indicating land. Land that was floating in the air. Soon they were close enough to discern the land’s shape: it snaked along like a rocky chain, splintering into forks at points, with some portions disconnected and floating off on their own. Just like a mountain range, if you had erased all of it below a certain elevation, and only the ridgeline remained. Near the center of the landmass, the mountains surrounded a large alpine lake, crystal clear, impeccably still, reflecting the moon like a mirror.

It was an uncanny sight. Izobel found it a little frightening, but perhaps more exciting. Izobel brought The Bougainvillea down towards the lake, and now they could see that the mountains were covered in forest. Ixora spotted a small clear spot to land on the edge of the lake, and the pirates disembarked. On the ground, they could see nothing but the lake and sandy shore in one direction, and impenetrably dense forest in the other. They decided to rest for the night and explore in the morning. Unsure what kinds of dangers they would find in this land, they retreated to The Bougainvillea and set it hovering off the ground before going to sleep.

In the morning, Ixora awoke to the sound of laughter. At least, that’s what she thought she heard. When she asked the others, none of them had heard anything, and when she tried to focus her attention on the sound, she couldn’t hear it. But if she ever found herself zoning out, it would come back, just at the edge of her awareness.

The pirates could see nothing of interest across the lake, so they set out to explore the forest, deciding to stick together. They weren’t sure what to look for, their only clue being Izobel’s story that the treasure was in a shrine somewhere. But so far they hadn’t seen any evidence of human structures. Just trees, shrubs, grass, leaves, dirt, and boulders everywhere they went. No animals of any kind either. No insects, no fish, no birds.

About an hour’s hike into the forest, Ixora spotted a fox from the corner of her eye. It paused for a moment, looking at the group of pirates with its head tilted, then darted off into the brush. They followed, and saw it stopped just ahead, looking at them. Then it ran off again. The pirates followed, and this pattern continued. It seemed like the fox was leading them, deliberately waiting for them to catch up as it went.

As they trekked deeper into the forest, they gradually started to notice other animals. First they saw a few butterflies, then heard the cawing of crows and spotted some in the trees. They caught sight of a line of ants crawling across a rock, frogs in a small pond, and a raccoon ambling along. They heard the cries of cicadas, saw beavers building a dam in a stream, glimpsed a snake resting in the dappled light of the sun on the forest floor, and saw a bear asleep under a tree. Newts, squirrels, woodpeckers, wolves, worms, turtles, salmon, crabs, octopus, hummingbirds, dragonflies, otters, rabbits, roly polies, ladybugs, and more, everywhere they looked the forest was now teeming with life and activity.

The fox wasn’t leading them up the mountains, but rather down into a heavily wooded valley between them. Deeper and deeper they hiked, and the forest grew increasingly dense, until hardly any sunlight reached them. At last they came to the foot of a great sheer cliff, with an entrance to a cave recessing into it. The fox gave a small yelp at the entrance of the cave, ran in a little circle, and then dashed away out of sight.

By the entrance of the cave there was a wooden pole stuck into the ground, with an image of the full moon carved into it, and a white ribbon tied around it, and an unlit lantern sitting on top. Pointing to the image of the full moon, Izobel whispered, “The emblem of the royal family.”

They entered the cave and found it was a tunnel that descended further. There were unlit lanterns occasionally affixed to the wall, and there was a dry torch and a small pot of oil sitting by the entrance. Presumably people were meant to take the torch and light the lanterns as they went along, but the torch and oil were so old, they were no longer usable. Luckily, Ian had brought an electric lantern with him, and the pirates used it to light their way through the tunnel.

The tunnel snaked downwards, and the pirates had to be careful to avoid tripping over stalagmites, or hitting their heads on stalactites from the low ceiling. As they traveled in, they heard what sounded like heavy breathing, which got louder as they went on.

Eventually, the cave tunnel opened up into an wide room. Crystal clear puddles covered the floor, and ancient rock columns stretched up to the ceiling. Standing before them, in the center of the room, was the source of the breathing. Ian held the lantern up, revealing a massive boar, perhaps thirty feet in height. It stood still, only its eyes turning to look at them.

“Ah… hello…” said Izobel quietly. The boar said nothing, just standing, breathing, and staring at them. Izobel turned to the other pirates. “It is called The Wise One. It’s the ‘treasure’ we have been seeking.”

Ixora looked up at the boar, staring back at it. “You know about this boar, ‘Bel? What’s its deal?”

“The legends of the royal family state that it is the oldest living creature in existence, older than the entire human race. They say it knows all things that can be known, and is incredibly wise. In ancient times, members of the royal family would routinely visit it to seek its counsel in times of trouble. A magnificent treasure, is it not?”

“Woah. It talks, does it? Like the animals in the kid’s stories?” Iyo cocked her head to the side, looking up at the boar.

“About that…” Izobel cast her eyes down. “The art of speaking the languages of many types of animals, including boars, has long been a tradition passed down by the royal family, up until my mother. Regrettably, I never learned. Alas, my family line ends with me, and the art may be lost forever…” Izobel looked up at the boar sadly. She waved at it and tried to address it again, but it just stared back.

“The ability to talk with animals? Incredible,” remarked Ian. He was taking notes in a small book that Bea had provided him, and was drawing a rough sketch of the boar as well. “So what are you going to do now, Izobel? I mean, given that you cannot talk with it.”

“I don’t know,” she responded, still looking at the boar. She shook her head. “I guess it can’t do anything for me now. But still, I’m happy I got to come here at least once. We can go.” As she said this, though, she lingered in place.

Ixora asked, “So I’m mighty curious, Izobel. If ye could talk to it, what would you ask it? Since it’s supposed to know everything an’ all.”

“Hmm...” Izobel thought for a moment. “I suppose even that itself is a good question: ‘What should I ask?’ I don’t even know.”

The pirates waited in silence while Izobel thought. Only the sounds of the boar’s breathing, Ian scratching in his notebook, and the dripping of water could be heard, echoing through the cavern.

Izobel continued, “...I guess I’d ask it, what was the purpose of my life? What have I lived for? I lost everything, and accomplished nothing. What should I do tomorrow? For what do I wake up in the morning?” Izobel looked at the boar as she spoke, and in her voice Ixora could hear an undertone of pleading, as if she were trying to will it to respond. But it did not. 

“Oh Izobel… I don’t think it would be able to answer questions like that,” said Ixora. She gave Izobel a hug.

“No I suppose it wouldn’t, huh?” Izobel exhaled, and let out a little laugh. “Well, I’m satisfied. Thank you all for taking me here. Let’s be off.” Izobel gave a bow to the boar, and it let out a grunt, perhaps in approval. Each of the other pirates bowed in turn, and then they departed.

The journey back to The Bougainvillea was a quiet one. The multitudes of animals they had seen before were gone. But as they hiked back to their ship, each time they weren’t sure which direction to go, Ixora would happen to catch sight of an animal or two, as if signalling the way to go, and they would head that direction. In this way, they found their way back to The Bougainvillea without trouble, reaching it around sunset. They camped in their ship for the night, then headed back to the Adventurers’ Guild in the morning.

The adventurers hosted an impromptu celebration for them upon hearing the news of their journey. “Remarkable discoveries indeed!” declared Bea, raising a toast to the pirates. “Truly the wonders of the world never cease to amaze! I thought just about everything there is to know about Interlunium was in our archive, but it seems there are many mysteries still awaiting us!”

## Chapter 7: Ixora and Amaryllis

The Blood Blossoms sat around their dinner table aboard The Bougainvillea, planning their grandest heist yet: they would sneak into the Interlunian royal palace and steal the royal crown. Well, perhaps it was not so grand a heist: in truth, the crown was no longer in use since the revolution that deposed the monarchy. Nevertheless, it retained cultural significance in the minds of Interlunians, and was kept under strict guard in the old throne room, displayed to the public only during holidays.

The idea came into fruition when Izobel mentioned a desire to see the capital once again. She had not been back to her home city in over twenty years, and thought it would now be safe to walk the streets once more, unrecognized, as an ordinary citizen. Then Ixora suggested she could do her one better, get her into the castle itself, and perhaps even reclaim her crown. Of course reclaiming the crown wouldn’t bring her any real political power, but that wasn’t the point. It would just be a nice trinket to hold onto for sentimental value, wouldn’t it? And if they got tired of gazing at its shininess, they could sell it to Mister Marius for an absurd amount of money, and be set for the rest of their days. Probably. Assuming they didn’t splurge it too quickly.

Anyway, the plan was simple enough. Ixora, Iyo, and Izobel would sneak into the palace via a secret passage that Izobel knew about. In fact, it would be the same secret passage she had used to escape the palace during the revolution. Once inside the palace, they would split up. Iyo would start a commotion to distract the guards, while Ixora would go to fetch the crown. Meanwhile, Izobel would head for the castle’s airship docks, and unlock them. Ian would arrive at the docks with The Bougainvillea, and the pirates would use it to make their escape.

All agreed it was a good plan, and so the pirates charted a course for the Interlunian capital city, Shining Earellium.

Shining Earellium is the republic’s largest city, situated on the northern edge of Interlunium’s great bay. It boasts no city walls, and is surrounded on three sides by gentle grassy plains -- unusual characteristics for a state capital, since they make it easy to surround and completely militarily indefensible. However, the open nature of the capital is part of what endears it to its citizens, who see it as a symbol of Interlunium’s peace and prosperity.

As the Blood Blossoms flew towards the capital, a northern wind was at their backs, as if encouraging them along. It was a cool spring day, and they arrived in the early hours of the morning. They planned to land a distance away from the city, rather than at the city docks, figuring they might be recognized as a pirate ship.

“But first, I wanna take a flyover tour!” called out Izobel, and instead of landing she led The Bougainvillea on a playful path circling above the city.

The pirates grasped the rails of the deck and leaned over, looking down upon Shining Earellium. On the southern edge of the city they could see the docks on the bay, packed with water-traveling ships and cargo, and porters and sailors carrying goods from all over the world into the city. North of it they could see the business district, with its grand buildings and their edifices decorated with rich relief sculptures of plants and animals, meant to show off the wealth of Interlunium’s greatest corporations. Scattered around the city, they could see the various residential districts, with rows upon rows of small colorful houses, high rise apartment buildings, and occasional large mansions with walled estates. To the northwest they could see the university, like a small quiet island, isolated from the rest of the city by huge tracts of parkland. In the northeast stood the great Full Moon Palace, former seat of the monarchy, current seat of the senate, featuring a distinctive smooth shining white marble architecture, with multitudes of tall, thin spires that pierced the sky.

In the heart of the city, of course, was downtown, its streets packed with people out and about enjoying the morning. They could see the markets crowded with buyers and sellers haggling over goods, cafes with people sitting outside enjoying desserts and drinks, the churches occupied with worshipers, and the bathhouses lively with sports and entertainment. As The Bougainvillea flew low over the city, children playing in the streets stopped to point and wave.

Iyo, who had never seen the capital before, was jumping up and down with excitement. “Oooh the capital looks so pretty! I see now why they call it ‘Shinin’’. Say, before our raid, let’s stop at one o’ them cafes! We can spend the money we got from the Adventurers’ Guild!”

“I could go for that,” said Ian. His eyes, too, were shining with excitement as he looked over the city. “It has been a while since I was last here, but I know some places you are going to love, Iyo.”

Izobel, a lump in her throat as she gazed out over the city, managed to say, “Dessert at a cafe does sound rather nice.”

“A’ight, a’ight.” Ixora made a show of grumbling, but inside she was smiling. “We’re in no rush.”

The pirates outside the suburbs of the city, then headed for downtown. As they walked through the streets, Izobel could hardly contain herself, to be surrounded once more by the people of the capital, the sights, sounds, and scents of the shops, and the familiar view of the spires of the Full Moon Palace looming above. Ian acted as a tour guide for Iyo, pointing out the wonders of the capital as they walked by, a shop of miniature clockwork animals in particular catching their attention. Ixora, never someone who liked crowds or the capital, felt vaguely unsettled, but she kept herself amused by people watching. She was curious to see if the people of the capital looked happy. She saw someone that looked like a government beaurocrat, rushing about with a concerned look on his face. She saw a young family fighting amongst themselves, tears in their eyes. She saw an old poet trying to sell his work to people on the streets, but being ignored. She saw happy people too, plenty of them out enjoying the day. And she also caught people looking at her. She wondered if they recognized her as a pirate, and if they were afraid of her.

Looking up into the sky, she saw a fleet of warships approaching from the south, which halted at the edge of the city. No one else showed any concern over this -- they appeared to be the republic’s own army, returning to base.

About two hours later, the pirates were just finishing up a nice cake at Ian’s favorite cafe when they suddenly heard shouting and sounds of a commotion. A group of soldiers rushed by, coming from the direction of the palace. They were yelling out, urging all civilians to take shelter. Then the pirates heard the sounds of canonfire and an explosion, and felt the earth shake. A moment of silence, more sounds of explosions, and shaking, followed. Around them, they saw civilians start to panic, crying out, fleeing into buildings.

It was clear the city was under attack. It must be Amaryllis’s planned coup we heard about, Ixora thought.

The pirates calmly stood up from their table. They all understood what was going on. “What should we do boss? Call off our heist and get outta here?” Iyo asked.

But there was a flash in Ixora’s eyes. “This might be a good opportunity, actually,” she said. “With the city under attack, no one will notice a couple of thieves sneak into the palace. I say we go, if yer all okay with the danger, that is.”

Iyo pumped her fist. “I like the way ya think, boss. I’m in.”

Ian shrugged. “No objections. I would not want to cut our return visit short, now would I?.”

“It’s ironic, isn’t it?” A wry smile was on Izobel’s face. “Last time I was here, I was sneaking out of the palace while it was under attack. Now I’ll be sneaking into it while it’s under attack.”

Ixora nodded. “Lead the way to yer secret passage then, eh, Izobel?”

Ian went running off to fetch The Bougainvillea while Izobel led Ixora and Iyo through the city towards her secret passageway entrance. As they walked through the streets towards the palace, people fled by them heading in the opposite direction. By now the sounds of explosions and the shaking were constant, and they could smell fire.

Izobel led them to the door of a small church. “An ideal place for an escape passage,” she explained. “Since no violence is allowed within its walls, a rule generally respected by all.”

They walked inside to find a group of clergy sitting, meditating, resolved to live or die inside its walls, come what may. One of the older clery gasped upon seeing Izobel, “Princess! Has the dead returned to walk amongst us at the end of days?” But Izobel just ignored him, and walked straight to the back of the hall. There she reached down to a cracked tile on the ground, and pulled on its corner. A portion of the floor lifted up, revealing a staircase descending into darkness. The pirates went down, closing the trapdoor behind them.

And then, silence. Underground they could no longer hear the sounds of the battle above. They were in a dark passageway. Izobel brought out a handheld lantern, and they could see dust and cobwebs everywhere. She led them through, and it was still about a two mile long walk to the palace. Along the way, in the flashes of lantern light they got glimpses of tattered books, stained paintings, chipped statues, tarnished suits of armor, and rusted weapons scattered about. “In the final moments before the revolution, we tried to save as much of our relics as we could down here, so that we might one day return to claim them,” explained Izobel absently, as if she weren’t talking to anyone in particular. “I would love to stop and look, though I suppose now is not the time.”

At the end of the passage they found a staircase leading up to the ceiling, along with a rusted lever on the ground. Izobel pulled on the lever but it was old and rusted and she wasn’t strong enough to move it. But Iyo gave it a good yank and a trapdoor in the ceiling opened up.

They climbed out and emerged into the palace’s interior chapel. It was a stunning contrast with the musky passage they had just crawled through: the room was sparkling clean, the floor a white marble as smooth as a mirror, and the walls and ceiling were made entirely of stained glass. The glass walls rose nearly fifty feet into the air, and depicted a forest scene, with images of foliage, animals, and fairies, and the full moon on the ceiling above. Light shone in through the glass from all directions, casting the whole room in a crystal clear green glow.

They all stood and admired the room for a moment. Then Izobel said, “Let’s move,” and they exited the chapel into a palace hallway. Here, the floors and walls were of pristine polished marble with golden detail work. Freestanding marble sculptures of varieties of plants, incredibly intricate with twisting stems and leaves, decorated the corners of the hall. All was quiet.

Here they split up as planned. Izobel went right down the hallway, headed for the airship docks, while Ixora and Iyo went left.

Ixora and Iyo darted down the palace halls, rounding corner after corner, Ixora keeping her ears alert for any unexpected sounds. Approaching an intersection, she motioned for Iyo to stop and be quiet. Ixora could hear the cries of soldiers and the clamour of armored feet, echoing a distance away. Luckily they seemed to be heading in the opposite direction from their destination, so they waited for the sounds to die out, then continued on. Passing hallway after hallway, off to the sides they could hear more sounds of fighting, weapons clashing and people shouting. But as they got closer to the center of the palace, things became quiet again. It seemed the palace guard must have been holding the line further out.

They approached the entrance to the palace’s great hall, a huge open room with high vaulted ceilings, the top lined with stained glass windows depicting the moon and the heavens. The walls were adorned in a neat array of different flags, one for each senator, representing each city, town, and village in Interlunium. Ahead lay a staircase leading up toward the throne room. Two armored guards with spears were posted by the stairs. They seemed restless, and were looking about nervously.

“Looks like it’s my turn!” Iyo drew her sword and prepared to enter the hall. “Go get that crown, Ixora!” She charged in and engaged the guards, then led them down a side passage, parrying their every blow, while avoiding landing any hits on them herself.

Ixora headed up the stairs, climbing nine stories before arriving at a long, straight hallway, at the end of which lay huge white twin doors, forty feet high and innately carved. Ixora approached the doors and creaked them open just a tad, then slipped inside.

The throne room was largely empty, except for a midnight blue carpet studded with embroidered stars, which led across the floor to the shining marble throne. The back wall of the room was made up of windows that could open like doors and led out to a balcony that overlooked the city, from which the monarch would have used to address the people. The royal crown, just a thin ring of gold with an opal embedded at the front, sat on a pedestal in front of the throne. Ixora ran up to the pedestal and picked up the crown. She had come across many treasures during her time pirating, but the minimalism of the crown made it seem extra distinguished. Ixora turned it over in her hands, marveling at it.

While she was thus occupied, the doors of the throne room swung wide open in a crash behind her, and a lone knight strode into the room. The knight was clad in pure white armor and a dark velvet green cape, carrying a silver sword and shield, and had a revolver holstered on her hip. It was Amaryllis.

“What the-- Who in the world are y--” Amaryllis stammered as she entered the room, Ixora’s back still facing her. Ixora turned her head to look at Amaryllis.

Recognition dawned on Amaryllis’s face. “Ixora?” Her expression lit up and without thinking, she rushed forward to greet her old friend. But when she was about twenty feet away, she stopped, seeing Ixora’s weathered clothes, and the cutlass and pistol at her sides.

Ixora fully turned to face her. “Hey Amaryllis, long time no see.” She stood with a relaxed stance, one hand on her hip, and the other spinning the crown nonchalantly on her finger.

“...So, the rumors were true…” Amaryllis spoke quietly. “The pirate who has been making trouble all across Interlunium, it really was you, my old friend Ixora...”

“That’s me all right. Ixora Rubiaceae, dreaded captain of the Blood Blossoms, scourges of the skies and most feared sky pirates in all Interlunium.” Ixora adopted a wide stance and crossed her arms. “Though I must say, didn’t think word of a lowly thief like me would reach the ears of an illustrious general like yourself.”

Amaryllis just had a sad expression on her face. “What… what happened to you, Ixora? I always knew you as such a kind and caring girl. How could you fall to such base villainy?”

Ixora just shrugged, and played with the crown in her hands, pulling at it, looking at her reflection in the gold. “And what happened to you, eh Amaryllis? From village errand girl, to senator, to general, and now soon to be emperor I hear. I always knew you were headed for great things. Everyone in the village did.”

“I simply followed my road straight ahead to its logical conclusion. I wanted to make the world a better place. I could see my impact as a senator was limited, and I could see the government was too inept to really solve people’s problems. It was only natural, I had to keep rising, if I was going to make a difference. As emperor, I will finally be able to burn down this corrupt system from the inside, and enact fundamental institutional change.”

“Makes sense,” said Ixora. But she wasn’t really looking at Amaryllis, her head turned to the windows behind her.

“Don’t you see, Ixora? The revolution was a gift to you and me. By tearing down the monarchy and establishing the equality of all Interlunians, it granted us the opportunity to become whatever we wanted, the opportunity to remake our world as we see fit. But you… you squandered this gift. You became... a sky pirate? A purposeless vagabond who wanders the sky stealing from others, living only for vanities and indulgences? How could you waste your life like that?”

“Never thought that hard about it, I guess. Just went where the wind blew me.”

Amaryllis shook her head. “I… I’m disappointed in you, Ixora.”

Ixora yawned, then still holding the crown, gave a little wave. “Well, it’s been nice chatting with you Amaryllis, but I’ve got places to be.” She started to back up towards the windows at the rear of the throne room.

“Hold it right there.” In an instant Amaryllis drew her revolver and pointed it at Ixora.

Ixora stopped. “Hey now, Amaryllis, what’s this about?”

“The crown,” Amaryllis said. Now there was a growling undertone to her voice. “Hand it over, or I will have to kill you. I needn’t remind you that thievery of government property is punishable by execution. Not to mention the countless crimes of piracy that you still need to be held accountable for.”

Ixora tossed the crown into the air and caught it on her wrist. “What, you want this little crown?” She could hear the sounds of battle echo into the room from the windows behind her. It seemed the whole of Amaryllis’s forces would soon be upon the palace. “What do you need this for? Sounds like you’ll be emperor soon enough anyway.”

Amaryllis sighed. In a voice like she was lecturing to a child, she said, “Possessing the crown will confer legitimacy upon my rule. It is not merely enough to capture a city, to be an effective leader you must convince people you have the right to rule, which can be facilitated through the appropriate use of symbols, such as the royal crown. I need it.”

Ixora looked into Amaryllis’s eyes, and they held each other’s gaze. 

“Hmm… well then, it’s a shame I got to it first.” Ixora flashed a smile and a wink, then turned and ran out the windows behind her. Revolver still raised, Amaryllis hesitated, and watched her go.

Out on the balcony, Ixora could see the sky was dark with smoke, and the entire city was ablaze, whole districts crumbled into ruin. She could see Amaryllis’s legions clashing with the city guard in the streets, soldiers falling left and right, and Amaryllis’s forces steadily pushing forward. On the horizon, Amaryllis’s warships surrounded the city, sending out waves of smaller airships to bomb any strongholds of resistance.

According to their plan, Ixora leapt from the balcony to a nearby windowsill. Gingerly hopping her way across more narrow ledges and sills, she traversed the exterior wall of the palace. She was over a hundred feet high up, and the wind whipped at her face, and the smoke brought tears to her eyes. As she reached the corner of the palace, she jumped and grabbed onto the railing of the airship dock which jutted out from the palace. She pulled herself up onto it, and ran to the end, where The Bougainvillea lay waiting, along with Iyo, Ian, and Izobel.

Ixora tossed the crown to Izobel as she climbed aboard. “Let’s fly everyone!”

The Bougainvillea pulled away from the dock, rose above the burning city, and headed out to the open sky to escape. 

Iyo looked back, standing at the ship’s railing, gazing out over the destruction of the city, her eyes wide. “Can ya believe it? ‘Tis horrible…”

Izobel turned her head too, and halted the ship. “I can’t just leave, not this time…” She went to stand by Iyo, looking out over the city in desperation, wanting to do something, but feeling helpless.

Ian, too, went over to stand by them. “If only I had succeeded in learning the forbidden arts of magic all those years ago.” He sighed. “‘It is too dangerous and destructive,’ they told me. But alas, there were spells with the power to summon rain, just think how helpful that would have been here.” The others turned their heads to give him a surprised look.

Ixora gazed out over the city as well. “And I can’t let Amaryllis make such a mistake,” she said. “Take the ship down, ‘Bel. We’ll do what we can.”

Izobel landed the ship at the grand arch marking the entrance to the city, and the pirates ran into the inferno. What followed was hours of grueling hard work, as the pirates searched for civilians trapped under rubble or in the fires, and guided people to safety, all while the air continued to burn around them. There were only just the four of them, and there was a limit to how much of the city they could cover. But people around them listened to Ixora’s booming, commanding voice, and jumped in to help. When the dawn of the next day came, and the flames had finally died down, and Amaryllis’s soldiers marched through the city to establish their order, the exhausted pirates decided it was time to make their exit.

The Bougainvillea lifted off, rising slowly into the air once again. The citizens of the capital looked up and watched it go, its red hull standing out in the morning sky, now clear and blue. Ian ignited the engines, sending the ship rocketing off, and all knew that the Blood Blossoms had been there.

## Epilogue: To Faraway Lands

And there ends the recorded history of Ixora Rubiaceae and the Blood Blossoms, who lived during the golden age of sky piracy at the dawn of Interlunium’s republican era.

It is perhaps not a surprise that Ixora disappears from the historical record around this time. When Emperor Amaryllis Asparagales came to power and ushered in her imperial dynasty, she brought down the force of her legions upon outlaws. No longer would pirates roam the skies as they pleased.

Nevertheless, Ixora’s tales of daring continue to inspire the citizens of Interlunium to this day. Any parent can tell you how popular her stories are with children, although I must say, many of the legends propagated about her are clearly fantasies. In compiling this work, it has been my aim to separate fact from fiction, and recount only tales which are verifiable. The stories here are primarily drawn from reports the pirates themselves submitted to the Adventurer’s Guild, along with interviews conducted with people they mention, including the merchant Paulus, the black market crime lord Mister Marius, and the imprisoned sky pirate queen Aiana.

What I’m sure the readers want to know, of course, is what happened to Ixora. Surely she would not have let herself be captured and executed by imperial forces, she was too clever for that.

Well, after scouring the archives of the Adventurers’ Guild, I am happy to report some new findings. One of the last notes by my predecessor, the former guildmaster Bea, shortly before she herself disappeared, are records that people named “Iyo Blossom”, “Ian Blossom”, “Izobel Blossom”, and “Ixora Rubiaceae” registered as adventurers and requested passports to travel beyond the borders of Interlunium.

So there you have it. It seems they continued their adventures in faraway lands. It is my wish that they continued to serve as an inspiration for all those who would wander where the wind whispers.

I would like to end on a final question and point of speculation. Something that becomes clear from the narrative is that “Iyo”, “Ian”, and “Izobel” were all fake names adopted when they became pirates, and it appears that they used the fake surname “Blossom” as well. But what is curious is that “Ixora Rubiaceae” seems to have been Ixora’s original name. In fact, archaeologists have found a birth record from the ruins of her home village indicating this. Personally, I wonder why she never changed her own name, despite advocating for the importance for pirates to abandon their history. What are we to make of this apparent hypocrisy? Perhaps I am reading too much into the narrative, but I get the sense that behind her tough pirate credo and cool demeanor, Ixora had a sentimental side as well, that she never truly let go of.

Will we ever know the true Ixora, as a person? Probably not. But as time continues to march ceaselessly on, and the story of the Blood Blossoms inevitably degenerates into myth and legend, I would invite readers to remember that Ixora was an ordinary person just like you or me. Driven by the wind, yes, but also, driven by the beating of her heart.


# Appendix: People, Places, and Things

## Ixora Rubiaceae
Age 30. Captain of the small-time sky pirate gang the Blood Blossoms. Born in the remote forest village of Eudicots, Ixora turned to piracy after escaping from imprisonment for standing up to tax collectors hounding her village. She is said to have sharp senses of hearing, smell, and sight, as well as being able to move silently, useful skills for thievery. She is known for liking flowers and the color red.

## Iyo
Approximately age 27. The Blood Blossoms’ master of offence, she fights on the frontlines of their pirate raids using her sword, and also mans their ship’s cannons. Much about her birth and early life are unknown, including her original name. We know spent her youth living in poverty in a small trading town at Interlunium’s southern border, and it is said that her father was a foreigner. At a young age she joined a local pirate gang. She is skilled with many types of swords including sabers, longswords, and greatswords, but favors a curious curved blade known as a katana.

## Ian
Age 26. The Blood Blossoms’ mechanic, cook, and quartermaster. Formerly known as William of Sparking Dew, the youngest son of one of Interlunium’s noble houses. He has seven older brothers and one younger sister. Ian studied airship engineering at premier university in the capital before being expelled and disowned by his family following a scandalous incident, after which he fell into piracy.

## Izobel
Age 65. The Blood Blossoms’ pilot. Formerly known as Fredericka of the Full Moon, crown princess of the Interlunian royal family. Despite being in line for the throne, it is said that she didn’t take her duties seriously, and rarely left the palace. After the monarch was deposed and her family was killed in the revolution, Izobel fled to a monastery where she lived in hiding.

## Amaryllis Asparagales
Age 34. Ixora’s childhood friend, known for being ambitious, and helpful to all. Following the revolution, Amaryllis was elected a senator to represent her home village of Eudicots. She was a hugely popular politician in the capital, and quickly rose through the ranks, before becoming a general commanding one of the republic’s armies. She is said to be skilled with many musical instruments, her favorite being the piano.

## Beanne Nicaea
Age 30. Guildmaster of the Interlunium Branch of the International Adventurers’ Guild. She goes by the nickname “Bea”. She was once a famous adventurer, but eventually fell out of love with it, and took up work running the Adventurers’ Guild instead, preferring to spend her time assisting other adventurers. She is known by others for being fashionable, and for taking great care in maintaining her appearance.

## Fava of Fragile Granite
Age 46. He was once a proud knight serving the Interlunian royal family. Through his reputation for honesty and trustworthiness, his career remarkably survived the revolution, and he transitioned to serving in Amaryllis’s republican army. After Amaryllis’s plans to overthrow the government were exposed, he took the blame for it, and was exiled. In his free time, he enjoys playing board games, particularly chess.

## Aiana
Approximately age 50. Full name unknown. Captain of the sky pirate gang the Crimson Crows, the largest and most cruel pirate gang operating in Interlunium. She is famous for her skill at sword duels, card games, and gambling, and seems luckier than any person ought to be.

## Paulus Paulus II
Age 52. A merchant dealing in tea and other fine goods favored by the rich. Son of Paulus Paulus, who was in turn the son of Paul Paulus. His three sons are also all named Paulus.

## “Mister” Marius
Age unknown. Full name unknown as well, people simply call him “Mister Marius”. A lord of the black market operating from Brave Darjeelinum, he will trade with anyone and in any manner of goods he can find, no matter how illegal. His day job is running a milk cafe, which he is convinced will become a big hit one day, but it hasn’t really taken off. The locals know him as a kind man who can help them find anything they are in need of.

## Interlunium
The realm this story takes place in. The land is roughly shaped like a crescent moon, with mountains curving along the northern and eastern borders, and a great bay in the center, opening up to the ocean in the west. To the south lies the hostile nation of Saturnium, the border being a wasteland devastated by centuries of war. Interlunium was formerly a kingdom ruled by the Full Moon family for about seven hundred years. Twenty years ago it underwent a democratic revolution in which the monarchy was deposed and a republic was established. Around the world, Interlunium is known for its production of airships and fine clockworks, as well as all manners of art, particularly that displaying nature.

Readers may wonder if there is a connection between Interlunium’s name, the royal family’s name Full Moon, and the fact that the land is shaped like a crescent moon. In fact, according to oral tradition, the founding queen of Interlunium is said to have named her family and her kingdom after the shape of the land. However, it’s unclear why she chose the name Full Moon if the land is shaped like a crescent moon. Scholars have proposed various theories, but there is no consensus.

## Eudicots
A tiny remote forest village in Interlunium, Ixora and Amaryllysis’s birth place. It is a self-sustaining village with almost no contact with the major cities of the realm. Most Interlunians have never heard of Eudicots, although if it is known for one thing, it is a legend that there is a portal to the underworld nearby. They say, if you trip and fall into a puddle on a rainy night in the forest near Eudicots, you may find yourself in the underworld, where you will be given the chance to fight and overthrow Death, and become Death yourself.

## St. Marcella’s
A monastery on the mountains bordering Interlunium to the north. It used to be a fortress known for its impenetrable walls, critical for defending Interlunium’s northern border. However, with the advent of airships it became functionally useless, and was converted into a place for religious study. It is an isolated and insular place, and it is said that many strange and possibly illegal things go on within its walls, including rumors of the study of magic. 

## Brave Darjeelinum
Interlunium’s famous flying city, recognized the world over as a marvel of engineering. It migrates across the realm during different seasons to optimize trade. Brave Darjeelinum is Interlunium’s wealthiest city, even eclipsing the capital itself. The city is built in a pyramid shape, with tiers, where the wealthier citizens live on the upper levels, and the poorer citizens live on the lower levels. Brave Darjeelinum locals often refer to the city simply as “Port Town”, for the hundreds of ports that jut out from the city’s perimeter to accommodate merchant ships.

## Old Darjeelinum
The crater of earth left behind when Brave Darjeelinum was raised into the air. When Interlunians commit crimes that aren’t serious enough to warrant execution, they are often exiled to Old Darjeelinum.

## Ceyloner
Also known as the “pirate’s paradise”, an unofficial town where pirates congregate. Ceyloner is high in the snowy eastern mountains of Interlunium, built into a large cave that cuts into the flat face of one of the mountains, which according to legend was created by a dragon’s claw. It is completely inaccessible except by airship. Ceyloner is popular even among pirates from outside Interlunium, who bring in goods and culture from all over the world.

## Shining Earrelium
Interlunium’s capital city, a center of Interlunian arts, food, and culture. Its most notable landmark is the Full Moon Royal Palace, which has a distinctive smooth white marble architecture and features multitudes of tall, thin spires piercing into the sky. The palace was once the seat of the monarch, but since the revolution, it has become an administrative building for republican government and the seat of the senate. On special occasions the public is let inside to view artwork in the palace dating back to ancient times, including the royal crown.

## Mats-Ela
A land that features in Interlunian childrens’ stories about fairies and talking animals. Scarce details are given about it in the stories, aside from offhand mentions of forest, lakes, and caves. Scholars debate over whether it refers to a real place in Interlunium, or whether it is merely a fiction.

## Airships
Interlunium’s favored method of transportation, invented approximately twenty years ago. They are customarily categorized into several classes:
- House class: Immobile-type airships, essentially floating buildings. They are designed for stability, and can only make small, slow movements to adjust their position.
- City class: An entire floating city. The only one created so far is Brave Darjeelinum, although others are currently under construction, inspired by Brave Darjeelinum’s trading success and wealth.
- Hummingbird class: Small, single-person airships. They are designed to be able to make quick, highly precise movements. However, they do not have a high top speed, and they carry little fuel so they cannot travel long distances. They are often used to carry and place materials in construction work, and are also used in fleets by the army.
- Pigeon class: Midsize, midweight, highly mobile airships. They feature powerful wings, customarily designed to look white and feathery. The wings beat much like a bird’s wings, allowing these airships to pull off maneuvers that birds do, such as dives. Pigeon class ships are typically built to hold between ten and fifty people. They are the airships of choice for sky pirate gangs, and for families.
- Falcon class: Large airships built for high top speeds, and smooth accelerations and decelerations. Not great at turning. They are used for civilian transport between major cities. 
- Airbear class: Large airships built for carrying cargo. They have a low top speed but are built for stability. Favored by merchants.
- Skywhale class: Also known simply as warships. They are huge airships that carry troops, army gear, and even other airships. 

## The Bougainvillea
A small pigeon class airship used by the Blood Blossoms. Formerly known as The Introspection, it was stolen from a small port town on the southwestern shore of Interlunium, painted red, and renamed The Bougainvillea. Ian outfitted it with a number of additions, including a rocket engine that can burst high acceleration, facilitating quick getaways.

## Sky pirates
Outlaws who wander the skies in airships. Primarily they steal from merchants, although they’ll take any opportunity to get treasure or something that will sell on the black market. Sky piracy is a crime punishable by execution, though pirates are rarely pursued by the army, who tend to be occupied with defending Interlunium’s borders, or maintaining political position.

## Adventurers
Wanderers who spend their time exploring the world, seeking out mysteries and discoveries. They are known as do-gooders who help all they come across. It’s a somewhat new, trendy occupation for young people.

## Merchants
The big business in Interlunium, thanks to Interlunium’s generous free trade laws. Merchants travel the realm in airships, trading goods wherever they think might be profitable.

## Clergy
People who spend their time practicing and studying Interlunium’s most popular religion, known simply as The Awareness. The Awareness describes the existence of several gods including Time, Sight, Shrubbery, Glass, and Death, who work together to keep Interlunium in balance.

## The Interlunian Military
Soldiers who are responsible for defending Interlunium’s borders from invaders, and also act as a police force on the citizens. The military is divided into four armies: the army defending the southern border led by General Amaryllis, the army which maintains order in central Interlunium led by General Tertius, the army that defends the northern and eastern borders led by General Fallen Snow, and the army stationed in the capital led by a senator whose appointment rotates on a yearly basis.

## The Interlunian Senate
The lawmakers of Interlunium who reside in the capital. One is from each city, town, and village in Interlunium, and each has equal voting power. It is up to each particular city, town, and village to decide how they elect their senator.

## The Interlunian Noble Houses
The elite families of Interlunium society. In the time of the monarchy, they had legal immunity, and could not be sued by or charged for crimes against any non-nobles. After the revolution, they lost their extra legal status, but still retained a great degree of influence. The families are all named after nature phenomena. Examples include Full Moon, Sparkling Dew, Fragile Granite, and Fallen Snow.

## The Revolution
Twenty years ago, an uprising in Interlunium’s capital deposed the monarchy and declared the state a democracy. The exact spark that set off the revolution is unknown, but many historians argue it was a primarily economically motivated event. Following the revolution, Interlunium saw an explosion in economic prosperity, innovation, and social mobility, setting it up to be a major world power.
