# In the Time of Ixora Rubiaceae

## Chapter １
## The Daily Life of a Sky Pirate

One early summer midday, the mercantile airship The _Philosophy_ drifted across the skies above the Republic of Interlunium, heading north towards the capital city. Boundless blue sky stretched out in all directions, and huge fluffy white clouds floated by, carried west by a gentle wind. Down below on the earth, fields of green and gold blanketed the land, crisscrossed by an intricate network of roads and rivers. From sky to land to water, the world was brimming with life and with people. Farmers, merchants, clergy, soldiers, and more, each person scrambling about, each trying to get somewhere, each carrying on their own personal dramas, each the protagonists of their own stories…

In the innermost chamber of The _Philosophy_ sat Master Paulus, head merchant of the trading company _Paulus & Sons’ Tea & Etceteras_. He was sipping tea and pretending to do work on his trading empire. Really though, he was just dreaming of corruption. The past few years had been plagued with constant political upheavals. But with every change in power, there was a chance to get in on the side of the new government and secure favorable trading grants. And recently, there were rumors going around that a new popular fast rising general in the army might be aiming to overthrow the senate in a manner of months. Paulus was imagining himself getting on this, and establishing lucrative connections for years to come…

Half asleep while entertaining such thoughts, Master Paulus was shocked awake by a crashing sound, and his ship lurching violently. He leapt out of his chair, banging his head against the ceiling, then fumbled to button his coat and rushed out of his room to see what was amiss.

The scene that greeted him made it clear what had happened. A small, rickety airship, sloppily painted a deep crimson red, had crashed into The _Philosophy_’s starboard broadside. On the side of the smaller airship was written the name _Bougainvillea_ in cursive gold letters. It was flying a huge, tattered black flag with a blood red flower insignia embroidered on it. A board had been laid between the two ships, and three people had crossed over from The _Bougainvillea_ to The _Philosophy_. They must be pirates! The pirates were addressing The _Philosophy_’s crew, who had gathered in a group. The pirate in front was speaking in a booming voice. 

“The name’s Ixora Rubiaceae, dreaded captain of the Blood Blossoms, scourges of the skies and most feared sky pirates in all Interlunium!”, the pirate in front declared, while grinning broadly and holding a wide stance, arms crossed. She wore a striking red coat, with an elegant cutlass slung across one hip, and a hefty pistol holstered on the other.  “I hate beatin’ around the bush so I’m gonna keep this short,” she barked. “Yer bein’ robbed! Give up yer provisions and yer valuables and you can keep yer sorry lives, that’s the deal and I ain’t got the patience for negotiatin’!” Ixora drew her pistol, cocked it, and pointed it directly at the stunned Paulus, who was still trying to process what was going on.

“Ah-ah…” he stammered, unable to speak.

“Cat got yer tongue?” snarled Ixora. Then her eyes narrowed, and with her free hand she drew her cutlass. “I can make that happen for ye literally, if that be your wish.”

Paulus remained frozen so the _Philosophy_’s first mate, a scruffy young man, hurriedly stepped forward and bowed deeply. “Please excuse my master, missus,” he said, keeping his eyes closed, while repeatedly bowing. “Pray let us talk before taking any hasty actions!” He took a deep breath. Ixora eyed him, unimpressed. He continued, “We just didn’t know what to say. We were just so surprised, since we had never heard of your pirate crew before, and...”

“Ye what now,” snapped Ixora. “We’re the most infamous pirates in all the skies, I needn’t remind you.” 

“I mean, um, perhaps we never heard of you before because you must be a new and rising pirate crew! And indeed how courageous is that! Truly you are a symbol of the entrepreneurial spirit of our enlightened age! Um… uh...” The young man couldn’t figure out how to continue this train of thought, so he decided to change tactics. “Please have mercy on us! We are but a humble tea trading vessel, we carry no treasure that would be worthy of the status of illustrious pirates such as yourselves!” He got on his knees and bowed his forehead to the floor.

“Tea, eh…” Ixora turned her head towards her pirate crewmate standing to her right and whispered, “Know anything about this so-called tea, Iyo? That worth anythin’?”

“Bunch of grass water, isn’t it?” the pirate called Iyo mused. “Tried it once meself in that provincial port town we robbed a couple years back. Can’t say it made a good replacement for ale…”

The other pirate, who was standing on Ixora’s left added, “I read that It is indeed quite a valuable commodity these days,” he said. “A delicacy from far off lands, favored by the new senatorial class for its subtle and delicate flavor. They say it helps them cultivate a refined, noble air.”

“Thank ye Ian, I’m glad I keep you around for this fancy stuff,” whispered Ixora. She turned her attention back to The _Philosophy_’s first mate and declared loudly, “Ah... _tea_! Today we’ll be plundering this treasured delicacy! Hand over a good, ah, 50% of yer tea, and add in anything ya got good to eat onboard, and we’ll let ya go nice n’ peacefully. Fair deal for everyone, eh?”

Before the first mate could respond, Master Paulus, who had been quiet this whole time, blurted out, “F-fifty percent! Preposterous! We would never turn a profit at that rate! We will not turn over what is rightfully ours, and especially not to ruffians like you! You, you who don’t even know what tea _is_!” At this point he had worked himself up into a small fury. “You do know, don’t you, that the law of the land is free exchange! Pah! I scoff at your fifty percent! It is rightfully -- and lawfully -- zero! In fact, I have it in writing right here!” He pulled a neatly folded document from his pocket, opened it, held it out in front of his face, and began to read, “By guarantee of the senate, all trade in the republic shall be free, and enforced by the fullest extent of the state’s powers--”

Ixora didn’t say anything but rolled her eyes, and tilted her head to the right at Iyo. In the blink of an eye, Iyo dashed forward, drew her sword, and slashed through the contract, stopping her sword just an inch from Paulus’s throat.

“Look around ye, you oblivious fool,” Ixora said flatly. “We’re the ones with swords here, and we’re the law, eh?”

Paulus, completely cowed, did not seem like he could speak, so the first mate quickly interjected, “W-worry not Mistress Rubiaceae! We shall fetch the tea for you immediately!” He motioned to his crew members to start fetching the tea. “Quickly now!”

The crew busied themselves fetching tea and provisions and loading them into the pirate ship, and the first mate carried the shellshocked Paulus back to his room. Since the loading was taking a while, the crew even brought our chairs for the pirates to relax in while they were waiting.

Reclining in his chair, the pirate called Ian took out a sky chart from his coat pocket and studied it intently, plotting their next course. The pirate called Iyo stared up into the blue sky and looked for shapes in the clouds. “Beautiful day, isn’t it, Ixora? Ah, that cloud there looks like a pup I used to have when I was a wee lass. Ya see, there’s his ears and there’s his tail?”

Ixora sighed. “Today ain’t nothin’ special. Just tryin’a survive. At least we got another lot of provisions from this ship, should last us a few more weeks.”

After the loading was finished, the pirates boarded their ship The _Bougainvillea_ and pulled away from The _Philosophy_. Ixora called out, “Ye best not forget the name of those who robbed ye! The dreaded Blood Blossoms, nastiest in all the realm! Spread the word and tell yer friends, all should fear the flag of the _Blood Blossoms_!”

On cue, Iyo fired a burst from their ship’s cannon into the air, which exploded into fireworks displaying their flower insignia. Simultaneously, Ian ignited the ship’s engine, rocketing them away through the sky, where they disappeared into a cloud, out of sight.

Back on the _Philosophy_, Paulus had mustered up his sense of indignation and was loudly complaining to the first mate that they ought to call the army on the pirates and see justice served. But the first mate just sighed and explained they were long gone by now, and anyways, the army was too busy keeping the capital under control to deal with a couple of small time pirates.
