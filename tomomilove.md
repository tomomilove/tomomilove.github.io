# Things you do for me

You do so much for me, and I want to appreciate that! So I've compiled a list of things you do for me. I'll update it when I think of more things.

## You drive me places

You have spent countless hours driving me. Sometimes it's for us, so we can do something fun together. Other times it's just for me, so I can get dinner without having to walk there myself. Either way, driving takes effort, and it carries with it a responsibility for keeping us safe. Driving is something that I'm even scared of doing myself, and that makes me appreciate you taking on the burden that much more.

## You wash our dishes (and my roommates' dishes!)

It's a chore that I don't like to do, and you're always doing it for me. I'm trying to get better about helping you with this!

## You cook for me

Even when you're at my place, you will cook for me. Often we cook together, but if I ever hesitate or take a break, you will keep going on your own! I have to keep taking initiative just to keep up with you.

## You make my bed

## You prepare my toothbrush

## You cover my ears when the train comes

## You buy food for me

## You laugh with me

Lots of little things, but they mean a lot to me!

## You text me good morning

It makes me feel like the day is worth it.

## You visit me

I don't know if you can understand how much this means to me, but really, it's what keeps me going. What's the point of life if you're not living it with someone you love?

## You hold me and kiss me

A lot of times I feel like the world is a scary, dark, or overwhelming place. Nothing gives me more comfort than snuggling with you.

## You see the good in me

I make a lot of mistakes, but you always give me the benefit of the doubt. You always trust that my heart is in the right place.

## You love me

You love me and you show it, which means more to me than anything in the world.

# Selected memories

## Early days

It was a Cal Origami meeting. You showed up late, but I think you were bringing something to the meeting (like snacks?). I always had the impression that you were a cool person, like I wasn't. 

You baked me cookies for my birthday that year.

I remember the first summer I lived with Tamren and Yuki, you came over and we sawed ceran wrap. I always wished you were able to spend more time with us that year.

## Later days

One time there was a meteor shower. I was telling you I was disappointed my roommates didn't want to go look at it with me (or something like that). You said you would come over right then and look at them with me!! I think I said you shouldn't (it was late and you were far away), but I always remember that. I remember another time we both went on the roof at night, though.

I remember one day we spent together and you walked me home. But then I said I had to walk you home. Then we talked about how we would walk each other back and forth, and it would never end. In the end, I think what happened was I walked you half way, and then we parted.

I remember the days of doing linguistics homework with Rie. I remember those being such a chill time, I always enjoyed that.
