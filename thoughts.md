# Things you do for me

You do so much for me, and I want to appreciate that! So I've compiled a list of things you do for me. I'll update it as I think of more things.

## You drive me places

You have spent countless hours driving me. Sometimes it's for us, so we can do something fun together. Other times it's just for me, so I can get dinner without having to walk there myself. Either way, driving takes effort, and it carries with it a responsibility for keeping us safe. Driving is something that I'm even scared of doing myself, and that makes me appreciate you taking on the burden that much more.

## You wash our dishes (and my roommates' dishes!)

It's a chore that I don't like to do, and you're always doing it for me. I'm trying to get better about helping you with this!

## You cook for me

Even when you're at my place, you will cook for me. Often we cook together, but if I ever hesitate or take a break, you will keep going on your own! I have to keep taking initiative just to keep up with you.

## You make my bed

## You prepare my toothbrush

## You cover my ears when the train comes

## You buy food for me

## You show me funny pictures, videos, and stories

## You laugh with me

Lots of little things, but they mean a lot to me!

## You text me good morning

It makes me feel like the day is worth it.

## You visit me

I don't know if you can understand how much this means to me, but really, it's what keeps me going. What's the point of life if you're not living it with someone you love?

## You hold me and kiss me

A lot of times I feel like the world is a scary, dark, or overwhelming place. Nothing gives me more comfort than snuggling with you.

## You see the good in me

I make a lot of mistakes, but you always give me the benefit of the doubt. You always trust that my heart is in the right place.

## You love me

You love me and you show it, which means more to me than anything in the world.

# Interesting and inspirational quotes

Here is a collection of interesting quotes I collected over the years that I wanted to share with you. Also I provided some commentary for each. I may update this article when I find new interesting quotes.

“More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness.” -– Charlie Chaplin, _The Great Dictator_

One of my favorite quotes. Too often I see people arguing with each other over petty details. Like calling someone out for technically incorrect grammar. Why? What good does that do? Are they just trying to show the other person that they're smarter? No good will come from people trying to one-up each other in that way -- just bitterness. Let's try to be gentle with each other instead.

“You should speak casually, but you should never think casually.” – Stephen Boyd

I may say a lot of silly things, but I'm always thinking seriously.

“The pebble in your shoe that is only slightly annoying at first will become insufferable after 10 miles.” -- [Unknown source]

Anonmalous problems can be tolerated. But continuing problems must be fixed!

“No matter what, everyone will disappoint you. They won't mean to, but they will." -- [Unknown source]

I read this as a positive quote, actually. Understanding that they don't mean to disappoint you is the important part. Ultimately, I think people are trying to be good to each other.

"Never promise nothing." -- InspiroBot

This is from a bot someone put online that generates weird inspirational quotes. I liked this phrase it came up with. Sometimes people are afraid of promising too much, afraid of commitment. I guess they don't want to let other people down. But the opposite extreme isn't good either: it's not good to promise nothing. Commitments tie people together, and make them care about achieving their goals. I think that's a good thing. Sure, you won't always be able to fulfill your promises, but that's okay. Live a little!

"Hard to believe I used to think love was such a fragile business." -- Jenny Offill, _Dept. of Speculation_

I often hear people talk about love like it's fragile. Like a relationship that was built and nutured over years could be shattered on a single day, over a single misunderstanding. I think that's silly.

"If the human brain was simple enough for us to understand, we would be so stupid that we couldn't understand it." -- Jostein Gaarder, _Sophie's World_

This always struck me as a funny observation. It speaks to the idea that you will never be able to fully understand yourself; you will never have a complete perspective on yourself. You're not so simple that any one person (including yourself!) could truly understand you.

"Capitalists, workingmen, politicians, citizens--all breaking the law, or letting it be broken. Who is left to uphold it? [...] There is no one left; none but all of us." -- _McClure's_

A lot of times the world can seem like a pretty dark place. You hear all about crazy injustices happening in all corners of society. It's a little overwhelming and depressing. But never forget that injustices are done by people -- real people, not abstract evil enemies. And if people have chosen to do injustices, then it is equally possible they choose not to do injustices. We are all here. We can solve all of our problems. We just have to choose to do it.

"Logic and sermons never convince, The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul." -- Walt Whitman, _Song of Myself_

How do you convince someone of something they don't want to believe? Simply telling them with words isn't going to do anything. You have to get deeper into their soul, somehow. 

“Y is a crooked letter with a long tail” -- Marlon James, _A Brief History of Seven Killings_

Just in case this isn't clear without the wider context of the quote, I think this is a pun about the question 'Why' and the letter 'Y'. In other words, this quote is saying something like: "The question 'Why?' can lead you down a long, crooked rabbit hole." I just thought this was a really clever pun.

"Love may not be that easy, but it is that simple." -- [Unknown source]

I don't think love is complicated -- it's laughing together, eating together, walking together, being nice to each other... Yet, it seems like a lot of people have trouble with it. Why is it hard for people? So my strategy of love is to not forget the basic principles, how simple it really is: If we are happy being together, then we should be together. That's it.

“Everybody has a secret world inside of them. All of the people of the world, I mean everybody. No matter how dull and boring they are on the outside, inside them they've all got unimaginable, magnificent, wonderful, stupid, amazing worlds. Not just one world. Hundreds of them. Thousands maybe.” -- Neil Gaiman

Every person in the world is interesting. It's regrettable that we can't get to know them all, right? But I'm happy that you have shown me some of your worlds.

"If you're not spilling the tea, you didn't pour enough." -- me

Woohoo, it's my own quote! It means: Do more and more ambitious things until you fail. If you never reach the point of failure, how would you know that you went as far as you could have gone?

# Selected memories

## Early days

It was a Cal Origami meeting. You showed up late, but I think you were bringing something to the meeting (like snacks?). I always had the impression that you were a cool person, like I wasn't. 

You baked me cookies for my birthday that year.

I remember the first summer I lived with Tamren and Yuki, you came over and we sawed ceran wrap. I always wished you were able to spend more time with us that year.

## Later days

One time there was a meteor shower. I was telling you I was disappointed my roommates didn't want to go look at it with me (or something like that). You said you would come over right then and look at them with me!! I think I said you shouldn't (it was late and you were far away), but I always remember that. I remember another time we both went on the roof at night, though.

I remember one day we spent together and you walked me home. But then I said I had to walk you home. Then we talked about how we would walk each other back and forth, and it would never end. In the end, I think what happened was I walked you half way, and then we parted.

I remember the days of doing linguistics homework with Rie. I remember those being such a chill time, I always enjoyed that.
