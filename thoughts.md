## Things you do for me

You do so much for me, and I want to appreciate that! So I've compiled a list of things you do for me. I'll update it as I think of more things.

#### You drive me places

You have spent countless hours driving me. Sometimes it's for us, so we can do something fun together. Other times it's just for me, so I can get dinner without having to walk there myself. Either way, driving takes effort, and it carries with it a responsibility for keeping us safe. Driving is something that I'm even scared of doing myself, and that makes me appreciate you taking on the burden that much more.

#### You wash our dishes (and my roommates' dishes!)

It's a chore that I don't like to do, and you're always doing it for me. I'm trying to get better about helping you with this!

#### You cook for me

Even when you're at my place, you will cook for me. Often we cook together, but if I ever hesitate or take a break, you will keep going on your own! I have to keep taking initiative just to keep up with you.

#### You make calls for me

I never liked talking on the phone, and it's so nice that you are the one who calls restaurants to ask for reservations, and things like that. I would do it if you asked, but you just jump right into it!

#### You make my bed

#### You prepare my toothbrush

#### You fixed my blind for me

#### You cover my ears when the train comes

#### You buy food for me

#### You remind me to get dinner

#### You show me funny pictures, videos, and stories

#### You laugh with me

Lots of little things, but they mean a lot to me!

#### You text me good morning and sometimes call

It makes me feel like the day is worth it.

#### You visit me

I don't know if you can understand how much this means to me, but really, it's what keeps me going. What's the point of life if you're not living it with someone you love?

#### You hold me and kiss me

A lot of times I feel like the world is a scary, dark, or overwhelming place. Nothing gives me more comfort than snuggling with you.

#### You see the good in me

I make a lot of mistakes, but you always give me the benefit of the doubt. You always trust that my heart is in the right place.

#### You love me

You love me and you show it, which means more to me than anything in the world.
