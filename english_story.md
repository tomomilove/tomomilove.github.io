# Kowagarijanai Chronicles

## Chapter 1
## The labyrinth of the World Tree

Yggdrasil, the World Tree, is a massive tree located on a floating island in a remote corner of the world. Inside the tree is a labyrinth with many floors, filled with traps and monsters. People come from all over to explore the labyrinth, in hopes of getting all the way through, to the top of Yggdrasil. Why do they come? Legend has it that at the top of the tree lies a magical treasure with the power to grant any wish.

The people that explore the labyrinth are called adventurers. They form into teams called guilds, and work together to explore the labyrinth’s depths. Each guild has its own goals, stories, and histories...

In recorded history, only one such guild has ever made it to the end of the labyrinth and reached the top of the World Tree. This was the famed Luxendarc guild, who reportedly summited it two years ago. However, shortly after, they disappeared, never to be seen again. Rumor has it that when they reached the top, they wished for the power of the gods, and went to heaven. Is that heaven meaning paradise, or meaning death…?

## Chapter 2
## Alice

My name is Alice Smith. My day job is being a hero for my hometown: fighting off evil, and dealing with whatever problems arise. Admittedly, I am a small-time, rookie hero.

Presently, I am on an airship, bound for the floating town of Maginia, the closest town to the World Tree. There, I intend to start a guild to search for the magical treasure hidden that can grant any wish. When I find it, I will wish for world peace, and save the world.

## Chapter 3
## Tanaka Sensei

I travel with my friend, teacher, and mentor Tanaka Rin. She was my language teacher in high school, and also trained me as a hero.

Alice: Hey, Tanaka! How are you doing?

Tanaka: I’m good! How about you, Alice? Ooh, what’s that? What are you doing?

Alice: I’m writing in my journal. I thought I should start one for this new adventure.

Tanaka: Fun! Can I see?

Alice: No, it’s private!

Tanaka: Lame!

## Chapter 4
## Kowagarijanai

After arriving in Maginia, my first stop is the guild headquarters, where I can register my guild and recruit guild members. A man named Miura is in charge of guild registration.

Alice: Hello, I’m starting a guild.

Miura: You’re starting a guild? You’re sure? You know it’s dangerous right?

Alice: I’m a hero. I’m not afraid.

Miura: This isn’t a kid’s game you know. Many have died in the labyrinth. Courage is one thing, but you also need to have the skill and will to see it through.

Alice: I can handle it.

Miura: Well, if you pay me the registration fee, I’m not going to say no… So, the name of your guild is?

Alice: It’s Kowagarijanai! Don’t forget it.

## Chapter 5
## The ideal guild

Alice: We need to find other people to join our guild. We need at least 3 more people to have a complete guild.

Tanaka: What kind of people should we have?

Alice: I think our guild should be like Luxendarc guild. They were successful, right? And really cool. In Luxendarc guild, they had two attackers, a healer, a defender, and a debilitator. You and I are already attackers, so we need a healer, a defender, and a debilitator.

Tanaka: Ah, that sort of thing… Actually, I mean, what kind personalities are you looking for? We’re going to be spending a lot of time together, after all.

Alice: Someone smart, rational, polite, and doesn’t argue too much?

Tanaka: Ahaha, are you sure you want me in this guild?

## Chapter 6
## John

At guild headquarters, I seek help from Miura to recruit guild members.

Alice: Miura-san, we need a medic for our team, do you know any?

Miura: Unfortunately, none are available at this time.

Alice: I see some standing over there. What about them?

Miura: They are already assigned to more… senior guilds. 

Alice: …

Having no luck recruiting a medic, Tanaka and I take a break for lunch. After that, we decide to take a walk through the central plaza in downtown Maginia.

Alice: What are we going to do? We really need a medic.

Tanaka: Well--

Suddenly, a stranger’s voice interrupts us.

Stranger (in English): Helloooooo did anyone call for a medic?

Tanaka (in English): Hi!

Alice: Hello? Um, do you speak Japanese?

Stranger: Japanese? Of course! Why didn’t you say so?

Alice: You were the one who spoke first… oh nevermind. I’m Alice Smith. You are?

John: The name’s John Brown. I’m a medical student! Err, was a medical student. Now I’m an adventurer medic! Can I join your guild?

Alice: Aren’t you even going to ask what the goal of our guild is?

John: Well, what is it?

Alice: When we find the treasure, we will wish for world peace.

John: Sounds fun. Sign me up!

Alice: Actually, we’ll find someone else. Good day to you.

Tanaka (to Alice): Wait a minute, Alice. Don’t we need a medic?

Alice (to Tanaka): He doesn’t seem serious though.

Tanaka (to Alice): What other options do we have?

Alice (to Tanaka): _sigh_ Okay.

Alice (to John): Okay, you can join.

John: What if you offended me earlier, so I don’t want to join your guild anymore?

Alice: Fine, suit yourself. *beings to walk off*

John: Wait, wait! It was a joke, a joke! I’ll join!

Alice: Well, hurry along then.

## Chapter 7
## Lee

Alice: Miura-san, we need a defender for our team, do you know any?

Miura: Well, there is this rookie who just showed up. Doesn’t seem to know anyone.

Rookie: Hello. My name is Lee Jae-yoon.

Alice: So, what do you do for a living?

Lee: People call me a wanderer I guess?

Alice: A wanderer? Uh… what exactly do you do?

Lee: I go wherever the wind blows. I’ve been on so many adventures, travelled to all continents of the world, met so many people.

Alice: Okay… Sounds useful, I guess. When our guild reaches the top of the World Tree, we will wish for world peace. Do you believe in our cause and want to join?

Lee: A power strong enough to change the world… sounds like a real adventure. I wouldn’t miss it for anything.

Alice: Oookay then. Um, if you don’t mind me asking, why did you decide to become a defender, Lee?

Lee: Well, I had never done it before, and decided it would be fun to try! I have been an attacker many times in the past.

Alice: You’ve never done it before?

Lee: Nope, should be interesting!

Alice: Great…

## Chapter 8
## Yamamoto Sensei

Tanaka: Alice, meet Yamamoto Emika. She is an old friend of mine from teacher school. I requested her to meet us here, I think she would be good for our team.

Alice: Nice to meet you, Yamamoto-san.

Yamamoto: Likewise.

Alice: What do you do?

Yamamoto: I’m a teacher of battle tactics.

Lee: I’ve heard of her, she’s quite famous.

Alice: Wow, impressive. We’d really like you to join. When we find the treasure, we will wish for world peace. Do you believe in our cause and want to join?

Yamamoto: [Spacing out for a second]

Alice: Um?

Yamamoto: Huh? Oh yes, I’ll join.

## Chapter 9
## The road to the World Tree

The journey from Maginia to Yggdrasil is long and dangerous, and is itself a kind of labyrinth. First, we have to pass through some ancient ruins north of Maginia. After that, through a dense forest. After that, I don’t even know.

Alice: Everyone, we begin our journey to the World Tree tomorrow. Are preparations are complete, right?

Tanaka: Right!

John: Right!

Lee: Right!

Yamamoto: No.

Alice: Huh? What is it, Yamamoto?

Yamamoto: We need a map.

Alice: Unfortunately, there is no map. These lands are mostly unexplored.

Yamamoto: We need a map.

Alice: There isn’t one though?

Lee: I agree with Yamamoto that we need a map. Having a map will allow us to travel back and forth to Maginia easily, allowing us to rest when we get tired. If there isn’t a map, we should draw our own, as we explore.

Alice: Good idea, Lee. Tanaka, would you like to be in charge of drawing the map? You like drawing and writing, don’t you?

Tanaka: Leave it to me!

## Chapter 10
## The ruins

We travel north from Maginia to the entrance of the ancient ruins. No one remembers what these are for.

Entering the ruins, we are surrounded by high walls of stone. A canopy of trees is overhead, shading most of the area. Luckily, Lee has brought a lantern. We start traversing into the ruins. We find marrow hallways that sometimes lead to open rooms that lead to more narrow hallways. A fork in the road. We turn a corner, then turn another, and another, and we find a dead end. We backtrack, taking different forks in the road. Another dead end. I consult Tanaka on the map. It’s a very well-made map, and I can see some unexplored paths. We head in that direction, slowly progressing further and further into the labyrinth.

As we walk, I examine the ruin walls, which are overgrown with plants and flowers. Varieties I’ve never seen before, many very beautiful. I see Tanaka collecting some flowers. The walls are damp and I can smell water: I wonder if there is a river nearby?

## Chapter 11
## A monster appears!

As we advance through the labyrinth, I hear a sound in front of us. Suddenly, a monster leaps out and attacks me. I take the hit, then draw my sword. I swing at it, and miss. Tanaka is right behind me. She imbues her sword with fire and stabs at the monster, striking it. It comes at me again, and we trade hits. 

Yamamoto: Lee, defend her!

Lee, who has been striking at the monster from behind, remembers that he is supposed to be a defender. This time, when the monster lunges at me, he is there with his shield, defending us. The monster is momentarily stunned from its collision with the shield. A carefully aimed shot from Yamamoto’s gun takes it out.

Hurt and tired, I slump to the floor.

Alice: W-we did it!

Tanaka: Good job Alice and everyone!

Lee: What was that thing? I’ve never seen a monster quite like it.

Yamamoto: I’m not sure…

John: Uh… it was a carnivorous koala. It’s native to this area, and pretty common…

Alice: Hey! Where were you doing that fight? Can’t you heal me?

John: O-ohhh right!

John comes over and treats my wounds with a combination of magic and herbal medicine. 

Alice: Let’s press on.

## Chapter 12
## Strategy talk

We continue to advance through the ruins and find a small river, surrounded by a bed of tiny white flowers. It seems like a good place to take a break, so we all sit down.

Yamamoto: Remember our battle strategy, everyone.

John: What was that again?

Yamamoto: Alice and Tanaka are in the front lines, attacking head on. Lee focuses on defending them from attack. John and I stay in the back. John heals as necessary, and I take shots with my gun when I get a clear hit.

John: I get to stay in the back? Awesome!

Alice: Your job is serious, you know. Don’t do anything stupid.

John: I will only do smart things.

Alice: I’m sure.

## Chapter 13
## The labyrinth door

We continue advancing through the labyrinth. Twisted corridors turn into more twisted corridors. It all looks the same to me. We’ve been exploring the labyrinth for hours, and it’s late afternoon now.

Eventually, we reach a great door at the end of a hallway. A pungent smell wafts through…

Alice: An interesting door, let’s go in.

Yamamoto: Wait.

Alice: What is it?

Yamamoto: It is late, and we are tired. We should head back to Maginia first. Who knows what is behind the door?

Alice: I’m not afraid. We can take it. Right, Tanaka?

Tanaka: If Alice says so, I’m sure we can do it!

Yamamoto: …

John: Mehhh why do we have to go today? If it’s a fight, it’ll be the same tomorrow.

Alice: Don’t complain, John.

Lee: If even one of our members is tired, I think it makes sense to go back. We can’t fight without all of us. Let’s respect Yamamoto’s wishes.

Alice: Good idea from Lee. Let’s head back.

## Chapter 14
## Vivian’s inn

It’s late when we get back to Maginia. We need to find an inn to stay in, which we neglected to do earlier. We try the big inn in town, but it’s full. Eventually we come across a small inn nestled in a corner of downtown. Even though it’s late at night, we can smell the scent of cake and pastries coming through the door.

John: Let’s try this one!

Alice: Rare good idea from John!

We knock on the door but no one answers. Cautiously, I open the door.

Alice: Hello? Is anyone there?

I look around the room. It’s cozy for sure. There’s a small reception area with a desk. But the room is also a kitchen, and various desserts are on a table. The room is intricately decorated, but most of the decor seems to be handmade. 

I notice a young woman sleeping at the reception desk with a cat on her head.

Alice: Um… hello?

Woman: Customers…! Welcomeeee… zzz….

Alice: This is an inn, right? Do you have rooms available?

Woman: Rooms? Oh right, rooms… we have rooms. How many do you need?

Alice: 5.

Woman: Coming right up… bon appetit…!

The woman stands up. Her eyes are still closed, like she’s still sleeping. And the cat it still on her head.

Vivian: I’m Vivian. Ask me for anything you need. Happy to help… any customers...

## Chapter 15
## Breakfast

Everyone feels completely refreshed after the night at Vivian’s inn. In the morning, she serves us a breakfast of omelette, salmon, yogurt, persimmon, and hot chocolate. Incredibly delicious.

Looking around the kitchen,it seems we are the only people staying at the inn.

Next, we head back into the labyrinth, following our map directly to the great door.

Alice: We’re ready?

Tanaka: Yes!

Lee: Yes

John: Probably!

Yamamoto: Yes.

## Chapter 16
## Humongous plant monster

We open the door and step into the room, and are immediately greeted by an overwhelming, horrific smell. A huge flower-like, plant-like monster towers before us. I can see another door behind it. It’s clear that door is the exit to the ruins. We walk towards the door cautiously, and the monster bristles. It seems like we have no choice but to fight.

The monster lashes out at us with its vines. Lee is there in the front row, holding his shield to defend.

I rush towards the monster with my signature move: mirage sword! I strike so fast and so furiously, it is almost like I am two people at once. Tanaka is behind me, following my every move with her flame sword. 

Lee is doing a good job distracting the monster and blocking its attacks. However, suddenly there is a new surprise: the monster emits a cloud of poisonous gas. All of us feel ourselves getting sick and weak.

Alice: John?! Where are you?!

John: Uh yes! Coming! 

John rushes to prepare an antidote and deliver it to each of us in turn. Meanwhile, the monster takes the opportunity to strike at us and deal a lot of damage.

Alice: John, healing, now!

John: I’m trying!

Suddenly, a gunshot rings out from Yamamoto’s rifle. The carefully aimed bullet strikes one of the monster’s arms, disabling it temporarily. With the monster lacking a means of attack, John has the opportunity to finish preparing medicine for everyone. Feeling a bit better, Tanaka and I rush the monster again and trade blows with it. We can see it is getting weaker, but we are getting weaker, too.

Another carefully aimed shot from Yamamoto takes out its legs. It falls over, stunned and unable to move.

Yamamoto: Now is your chance! Strike with your full strength!

But Tanaka and I are too tired to use our special techniques anymore. We manage a few more hits with our swords, but it’s not enough to finish the job. Soon the monster is on its feet again. Adrenaline coursing through its body, it seems stronger and fiercer than ever. It readies its arms to strike at us. Lee tries to rush to our defense, but he is also tired, and can’t keep up a solid guard. We trade hits, and feel ourselves getting damaged. John, too, seems to have run out of medicine and can’t heal us.

I kneel on the ground, tired. The monster prepares to attack. Suddenly, Yamamoto rushes to the front lines, and parries its attack with her rifle. She is wielding it like a staff, expertly blocking its attacks. She sees an opening and shoots it point-blank in the face. It collapses, dead.

Yamamoto: It is disposed of.

Tanaka: Thank goodness!

John: We survived…

Alice: … Good job everyone. Let’s go back to Maginia.

## Chapter 17
## Celebration

Tanaka: Party time!!

Having just won our first major battle, we’ve decided to hold a little celebration.

Alice: Where should we go for our party?

Tanaka: To a bar!!

Lee: I remember seeing a bar near Vivian’s Inn.

Tanaka: Let’s go!!

Alice: Fine by me.

With Lee’s good memory and sense of direction, we find the bar easily. We go inside. A man greets us:

Kuwashil: Customers, welcome! The name’s Kuwashil, and I’m the owner of this bar. What can I get for you?

Alice: We’re having a celebration! Please bring out lots of food and alcohol!

Kuwashil: Coming right up!

We receive various dishes and drinks, all of it delicious.

Tanaka: Everyone, I have something to say! To my new friends, I love you all so much! I’m looking forward to so many wonderful adventures with you all in the future!

Alice: Uh, Tanaka Sensei…

Tanaka: Rin! My name is Rin! We’re all best friends now, so no need to call me “Tanaka Sensei” anymore!

Alice: Right… Rin-san.

## Chapter 18
## Talking with John

Lee: John, you’re not having anything to drink?

John: Haha, well, I’m still only 20, so…

Lee: I see.

Tanaka: Hahaha, cute baby John!

John: I’m not a baby!

Lee: Say John, you’re a student, right?

John: Well, I was a student. A medical student. Now, I’m an adventurer medic!

Lee: And why did you decide to study medicine, out of curiosity?

John: Hmm, no real reason, I guess.

Alice: Med school is really hard and really expensive, isn’t it? You sure you didn’t have a reason?

John: Well… I guess it just seemed like the most straightforward thing to do at the time?

Alice: I can’t believe you sometimes!

Lee: Now you’re an adventurer though, and being an adventurer is definitely not the most straightforward thing to do. Why become an adventurer? Why quit school?

John: Hmm… no real reason I guess. School was boring. Hated tests.

Tanaka: Me too! I hate tests! There are not tests in my class!

John: Woah, really? I want to join Tanaka’s class!

Yamamoto: Wait a minute, John. You really had no reason to become an adventurer? You would put your life on the line for nothing?

John: Uh… well… I don’t know! Geez, what is this, an interview?

Lee: Please excuse me. I didn’t mean to pry into your personal life.

Yamamoto: It was a serious question, though…

Alice: Anyway, I’m sure there was nothing interesting. John’s personal life is probably really boring.

John: Hey, I’m really interesting! Let’s talk about your personal life, huh Alice? What’s in that journal of yours you’re always writing in? 

Alice: Nothing interesting! Let’s talk about something else!

## Chapter 19
## Talking with Kuwashil

Kuwashil: You guys, you’re adventurers, right?

Alice: That’s right! We’re new adventurers. We’re Kowagarijanai guild!

Kuwashil: Kowagarijanai? Gahahaha! Anyway, why don’t you tell me about your adventures so far? Where have you been?

Alice: We went to the ruins north of Maginia. We drew a map, here take a look.

Kuwashil: Woah nice! It’s a good map. Say, you guys, have you been the Exploration Headquarters yet?

Alice: Exploration Headquarters? No, what’s that?

Kuwashil: It’s the place where Princess Persephone manages exploration efforts for the city. She’s making an effort to study all the lands surrounding Maginia. 

Lee: Princess Persephone is the ruler of Maginia, isn’t she? She’s interested in things like adventurers and exploring?

Kuwashil: That’s right. This is a fairly remote location after all, largely unexplored by humans except for our small city. You can imagine how it would be useful for Maginia to learn more about the surrounding area. You guys should go pay her a visit. I bet she’d find your map useful. Did I mention, if she likes your guild, you might become famous all over the town? Ahahaha!

Alice: Let’s go.

## Chapter 20
## Persephone

Tanaka and I head to the exploration headquarters, a large palace-like building in the center of Maginia. Until we got there, I didn’t know it would be so grandiose -- evidently, it is a place of some import. I feel nervous approaching it.

At the palace gate, we find a guard.

Alice: Can we enter the palace? I’d like to speak with Princess Persephone. 

Guard: Go right ahead. The public is permitted to enter.

We enter and find ourselves in a grand room, with walls of gold and a high ceiling. The far end wall is almost entirely made up of a windows that gaze out over courtyard gardens. We see a regal-looking woman standing there, gazing out. We approach.

Alice: Um, hello? You must be Persephone-sama.

Persephone: Ah, a new face. Welcome. You are?

Alice: Alice Smith and Tanaka Rin. We represent Kowagarijanai guild.

Persephone: Kowagarijanai…? Cute… Anyway, what can I do for you?

Alice: We explored the ruins to the north. We defeated a monster guarding the exit, and we drew a map. I’d like to submit the map to the exploration headquarters, it should make it easier for other adventurers.

Tanaka hands over the map.
Persephone: It is a very good map. Detailed and rigorous. Thank you, this will aid our exploration efforts immensely.

After looking over the map for some time, Persephone turns her attention to Alice and Tanaka.

Persephone: Young one, what is the goal of your guild?

Alice: We will find the magical treasure of Yggdrasil, and save the world.

Persephone: Is that so…? In that case, you are probably going to the Verdant Forest next, correct?

Alice: Yes, that is the direction we are going.

Persephone: In that case, I have an official request for you. Please map the forest for us, as well. It is a very dangerous area. It will help our exploration efforts a lot to have a great map. It will also help us if you catalog animals and plants you discover along the way. Rest assured, you will be compensated for your efforts. Though do be aware… the Verdant Forest is quite dangerous.

Alice: We accept this task.

Persephone: Excellent.

Alice and Tanaka turn to leave.

Persephone: By the way, what was the name of your guild, again?

Alice: Kowagarijanai!

Persephone: Kowagarijanai… okay. I won’t forget it. Be careful out there.

## Chapter 21
## The Verdant Forest

Continuing our adventure, we arrive in a magnificent sea of trees. They call this place the Verdant Forest, so thick with trees, shrubs, and all manners of plant life that it is like a labyrinth. Despite the density of the vegetation, light manages to shine through all the way to the forest floor, giving the whole area a bright, glowing appearance.

We traverse the forest labyrinth’s twisting paths, making sure to keep our map up-to-date. Along the way, we encounter several small monsters we need to fight, such as Violent Baboons, Mandrakes, and Ghost Owls. However, they do not give us much trouble.

## Chapter 22
## Mysterious fruit

We reach a dead end of a path through the forest. Here, I see a tree with a large, red fruit. I remember Princess Persephone told us to document the plants we come across, so…

Alice: Hey everyone, look, there is an interesting fruit.

Without any more prompting, Lee climbs the tree, grabs the fruit, and tosses it down to me.

Alice: Nice one, Lee!

The fruit is emitting a nice, sweet smell.

Tanaka: Looks tasty, and I’m hungry! Can we eat it, Alice?

Alice: Hmm… I’m not sure… Is it safe?

I’m not exactly a botanist, and I don’t know anything about what kinds of fruits are safe to eat.

John: This fruit is called Ruby Grapple… I think. I learned about it in botany class.

Alice: Oh, you did? Is it edible?

John: I don’t remember. Must have slept through that part of class, haha.

Alice: ...You never fail to disappoint me, John.

Lee: I have a strong stomach. I’ll try it.

Lee takes a bite.

Lee: It’s really good actually! My body feels energized. Everyone, let’s share it!

Tanaka: Woohoo!

Alice: Awesome! Thanks, Lee!

## Chapter 23
## Campfire chat with Lee
We spend the whole day traveling through the sea of trees. It’s getting dark, but we are far from Maginia and don’t want to head back. We decide to camp for the night.

We set up a campfire and sit around it. We do our best to cook dinner using ingredients we collected during the day: fruits and vegetables we found, as well as meat from monsters. Both John and Lee are surprisingly adept at cooking. Me, not so much.

Over dinner, we get to talking.

Tanaka: Hey, Lee!! Question!!

Lee: Yes?

Tanaka: You told us you were a traveler, and you have been on many adventures, right? Please tell us about your adventures.

Lee: Of course! Hmm, where to start…?

Tanaka: How about you tell us why you are wearing a pirate outfit, Lee? I mean, it’s a cool look and all, but is there a story behind it?

Lee: Oh, that. A short while ago, I was sailing with some ghost pirates. While we were sailing across the ocean, I saw the World Tree in the distance, and decided I had to check it out. That’s how I came to Maginia.

Alice: Uh… what? Ghost pirates?

Lee: Yeah. They’re more friendly than you might think, actually!

Alice: Is that so…?

Tanaka: Cool! How did you meet the ghost pirates?

Lee: Oh, that. Well, I was stranded on a deserted island, and I couldn’t figure out how to leave. Then, I found a portal to the spirit realm. I made friends with some ghosts there, and they were able to send a ghost ship to pick me up and get me off the island.

Tanaka: Wow…! What was it like being stranded on a deserted island...? 

Lee: It was interesting learning how to survive on basically nothing.

Alice: And how did you end up stranded on a deserted island?

Lee: Oh that. I was flying on a dragon over the ocean, but then we got attacked by an imperial airship that was chasing the dragon. I fell into the ocean, and washed ashore on the island.

Alice: You made friends with a dragon?! What?!

Lee: Oh, that. I was trying to steal its treasure, but then it caught me red-handed. However, I explained the the reason I wanted to steal the treasure was so that I could get money to buy medicine for someone else. It appreciated my honesty, so we became friends.

Tanaka: Wow, so many adventures!

Alice: Lee is so cool, huh?

John: Wow, you’re crazy, man.

## Chapter 24
## Oliver and Marco

The next day, we continue our traversal through the forest. Eventually, we come to a wide clearing. We see two men standing there, looking lost. One of the men is wearing a suit of armor and carrying a sword and shield. The other is dressed like a mage. They seem to be adventurers.

Alice: Greetings. I’m Alice Smith, and this is Kowagarijanai guild. We’re adventurers from Maginia.

The man with armor with armor speaks. 

Oliver: Howdy! We’re adventurers from Maginia too. My name’s Oliver, and this here’s my partner, Marco!

Marco: Nice to meet you.

Oliver: Say kid, you’re pretty young. What made you want to become an adventurer? Fame? Thrills? As for me, I’m in it for money. Gotta feed the family somehow, you know?

Marco: And I’m in it for knowledge. There are so many unknown plants and creatures out there to learn.

Alice: I’m trying to save the world.

Oliver: Gahaha that’s a new one! But hey, I like your style, kid. Here, take this ore. Marco and I collected a bunch of ore while exploring. It’s useful for marking weapons and armor, you know!

Oliver gives me some ore.

Alice: Wow, thank you! That’s so kind.

Oliver: It’s nothing!

Marco: It’s prudent for adventurers to watch each other’s backs in this dangerous world. We’re all in this together.

Alice: That’s right, isn’t it? Here, I’ll help you too. Take a look at this map of the forest we’ve been making.

Oliver: Woahhhh a map! That would be really useful! This place certainly is a labyrinth, isn’t it?

Alice: Why not make a copy?

Marco copies the map dutifully.

Marco: Why didn’t I think of making a map? Anyway, thank you very much!

Alice: Happy to help! Hope to see you guys again around!

And with that, we part ways.

## Chapter 25
## Napier’s shop

After another day in the labyrinth, we decide to head back to Maginia. I show the map we’ve made to Persephone, and she seems pleased. She pays us a considerable sum of money, and recommends we use it to improve our adventuring equipment. She recommends a shop in downtown Maginia run by a woman named Napier.

I decide to go to Napier’s shop alone, and I tell everyone else they have the day off. 

Entering Napier’s shop, I find it to be richly decorated. Suits of armor and weapons line the walls. In the corner, I can see medicines and other strange foods.

Napier: Welcome, customer. Napier speaking. New adventurer, are you?

Alice: That’s right. I’ve brought money and some ore. I’d like to make some new equipment, and buy some medicine.

Napier: As you wish!

Napier produces new armor and weapons for everyone in the guild.

Alice: Thank you very much. This will really help us explore the Verdant Forest.

Napier: You’re exploring the Verdant Forest, are you? Actually, can you do a request for me? Could you collect some mint grass for me? I’ll use it to make medicine to sell in the shop. I’ll pay you for your efforts, of course. It maybe be a little difficult to find, but...

Alice: Leave it to Kowagarijanai guild! We can do it!

Napier: Oh...? Good luck then.
