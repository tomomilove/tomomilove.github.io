# Kowagarijanai Chronicles

## Chapter 1
## The labyrinth of the World Tree

Yggdrasil, the World Tree, is a massive tree located on a floating island in a remote corner of the world. Inside the tree is a labyrinth with many floors, filled with traps and monsters. People come from all over to explore the labyrinth, in hopes of getting all the way through, to the top of Yggdrasil. Why do they come? Legend has it that at the top of the tree lies a magical treasure with the power to grant any wish.

The people that explore the labyrinth are called adventurers. They form into teams called guilds, and work together to explore the labyrinth’s depths. Each guild has its own goals, stories, and histories...

In recorded history, only one such guild has ever made it to the end of the labyrinth and reached the top of the World Tree. This was the famed Luxendarc guild, who reportedly summited it two years ago. However, shortly after, they disappeared, never to be seen again. Rumor has it that when they reached the top, they wished for the power of the gods, and went to heaven. Is that heaven meaning paradise, or meaning death…?

## Chapter 2
## Alice

My name is Alice Smith. My day job is being a hero for my hometown: fighting off evil, and dealing with whatever problems arise. Admittedly, I am a small-time, rookie hero.

Presently, I am on an airship, bound for the floating town of Maginia, the closest town to the World Tree. There, I intend to start a guild to search for the magical treasure hidden that can grant any wish. When I find it, I will wish for world peace, and save the world.

## Chapter 3
## Tanaka Sensei

I travel with my friend, teacher, and mentor Tanaka Rin. She was my language teacher in high school, and also trained me as a hero.

Alice: Hey, Tanaka! How are you doing?

Tanaka: I’m good! How about you, Alice? Ooh, what’s that? What are you doing?

Alice: I’m writing in my journal. I thought I should start one for this new adventure.

Tanaka: Fun! Can I see?

Alice: No, it’s private!

Tanaka: Lame!

## Chapter 4
## Kowagarijanai

After arriving in Maginia, my first stop is the guild headquarters, where I can register my guild and recruit guild members. A man named Miura is in charge of guild registration.

Alice: Hello, I’m starting a guild.

Miura: You’re starting a guild? You’re sure? You know it’s dangerous right?

Alice: I’m a hero. I’m not afraid.

Miura: This isn’t a kid’s game you know. Many have died in the labyrinth. Courage is one thing, but you also need to have the skill and will to see it through.

Alice: I can handle it.

Miura: Well, if you pay me the registration fee, I’m not going to say no… So, the name of your guild is?

Alice: It’s Kowagarijanai! Don’t forget it.

## Chapter 5
## The ideal guild

Alice: We need to find other people to join our guild. We need at least 3 more people to have a complete guild.

Tanaka: What kind of people should we have?

Alice: I think our guild should be like Luxendarc guild. They were successful, right? And really cool. In Luxendarc guild, they had two attackers, a healer, a defender, and a debilitator. You and I are already attackers, so we need a healer, a defender, and a debilitator.

Tanaka: Ah, that sort of thing… Actually, I mean, what kind personalities are you looking for? We’re going to be spending a lot of time together, after all.

Alice: Someone smart, rational, polite, and doesn’t argue too much?

Tanaka: Ahaha, are you sure you want me in this guild?

## Chapter 6
## John

At guild headquarters, I seek help from Miura to recruit guild members.

Alice: Miura-san, we need a medic for our team, do you know any?

Miura: Unfortunately, none are available at this time.

Alice: I see some standing over there. What about them?

Miura: They are already assigned to more… senior guilds. 

Alice: …

Having no luck recruiting a medic, Tanaka and I take a break for lunch. After that, we decide to take a walk through the central plaza in downtown Maginia.

Alice: What are we going to do? We really need a medic.

Tanaka: Well--

Suddenly, a stranger’s voice interrupts us.

Stranger (in English): Helloooooo did anyone call for a medic?

Tanaka (in English): Hi!

Alice: Hello? Um, do you speak Japanese?

Stranger: Japanese? Of course! Why didn’t you say so?

Alice: You were the one who spoke first… oh nevermind. I’m Alice Smith. You are?

John: The name’s John Brown. I’m a medical student! Err, was a medical student. Now I’m an adventurer medic! Can I join your guild?

Alice: Aren’t you even going to ask what the goal of our guild is?

John: Well, what is it?

Alice: When we find the treasure, we will wish for world peace.

John: Sounds fun. Sign me up!

Alice: Actually, we’ll find someone else. Good day to you.

Tanaka (to Alice): Wait a minute, Alice. Don’t we need a medic?

Alice (to Tanaka): He doesn’t seem serious though.

Tanaka (to Alice): What other options do we have?

Alice (to Tanaka): _sigh_ Okay.

Alice (to John): Okay, you can join.

John: What if you offended me earlier, so I don’t want to join your guild anymore?

Alice: Fine, suit yourself. *beings to walk off*

John: Wait, wait! It was a joke, a joke! I’ll join!

Alice: Well, hurry along then.

## Chapter 7
## Lee

Alice: Miura-san, we need a defender for our team, do you know any?

Miura: Well, there is this rookie who just showed up. Doesn’t seem to know anyone.

Rookie: Hello. My name is Lee Jae-yoon.

Alice: So, what do you do for a living?

Lee: People call me a wanderer I guess?

Alice: A wanderer? Uh… what exactly do you do?

Lee: I go wherever the wind blows. I’ve been on so many adventures, travelled to all continents of the world, met so many people.

Alice: Okay… Sounds useful, I guess. When our guild reaches the top of the World Tree, we will wish for world peace. Do you believe in our cause and want to join?

Lee: A power strong enough to change the world… sounds like a real adventure. I wouldn’t miss it for anything.

Alice: Oookay then. Um, if you don’t mind me asking, why did you decide to become a defender, Lee?

Lee: Well, I had never done it before, and decided it would be fun to try! I have been an attacker many times in the past.

Alice: You’ve never done it before?

Lee: Nope, should be interesting!

Alice: Great…

## Chapter 8
## Yamamoto Sensei

Tanaka: Alice, meet Yamamoto Emika. She is an old friend of mine from teacher school. I requested her to meet us here, I think she would be good for our team.

Alice: Nice to meet you, Yamamoto-san.

Yamamoto: Likewise.

Alice: What do you do?

Yamamoto: I’m a teacher of battle tactics.

Lee: I’ve heard of her, she’s quite famous.

Alice: Wow, impressive. We’d really like you to join. When we find the treasure, we will wish for world peace. Do you believe in our cause and want to join?

Yamamoto: [Spacing out for a second]

Alice: Um?

Yamamoto: Huh? Oh yes, I’ll join.

## Chapter 9
## The road to the World Tree

The journey from Maginia to Yggdrasil is long and dangerous, and is itself a kind of labyrinth. First, we have to pass through some ancient ruins north of Maginia. After that, through a dense forest. After that, I don’t even know.

Alice: Everyone, we begin our journey to the World Tree tomorrow. Are preparations are complete, right?

Tanaka: Right!

John: Right!

Lee: Right!

Yamamoto: No.

Alice: Huh? What is it, Yamamoto?

Yamamoto: We need a map.

Alice: Unfortunately, there is no map. These lands are mostly unexplored.

Yamamoto: We need a map.

Alice: There isn’t one though?

Lee: I agree with Yamamoto that we need a map. Having a map will allow us to travel back and forth to Maginia easily, allowing us to rest when we get tired. If there isn’t a map, we should draw our own, as we explore.

Alice: Good idea, Lee. Tanaka, would you like to be in charge of drawing the map? You like drawing and writing, don’t you?

Tanaka: Leave it to me!

## Chapter 10
## The ruins

We travel north from Maginia to the entrance of the ancient ruins. No one remembers what these are for.

Entering the ruins, we are surrounded by high walls of stone. A canopy of trees is overhead, shading most of the area. Luckily, Lee has brought a lantern. We start traversing into the ruins. We find marrow hallways that sometimes lead to open rooms that lead to more narrow hallways. A fork in the road. We turn a corner, then turn another, and another, and we find a dead end. We backtrack, taking different forks in the road. Another dead end. I consult Tanaka on the map. It’s a very well-made map, and I can see some unexplored paths. We head in that direction, slowly progressing further and further into the labyrinth.

As we walk, I examine the ruin walls, which are overgrown with plants and flowers. Varieties I’ve never seen before, many very beautiful. I see Tanaka collecting some flowers. The walls are damp and I can smell water: I wonder if there is a river nearby?

## Chapter 11
## A monster appears!

As we advance through the labyrinth, I hear a sound in front of us. Suddenly, a monster leaps out and attacks me. I take the hit, then draw my sword. I swing at it, and miss. Tanaka is right behind me. She imbues her sword with fire and stabs at the monster, striking it. It comes at me again, and we trade hits. 

Yamamoto: Lee, defend her!

Lee, who has been striking at the monster from behind, remembers that he is supposed to be a defender. This time, when the monster lunges at me, he is there with his shield, defending us. The monster is momentarily stunned from its collision with the shield. A carefully aimed shot from Yamamoto’s gun takes it out.

Hurt and tired, I slump to the floor.

Alice: W-we did it!

Tanaka: Good job Alice and everyone!

Lee: What was that thing? I’ve never seen a monster quite like it.

Yamamoto: I’m not sure…

John: Uh… it was a carnivorous koala. It’s native to this area, and pretty common…

Alice: Hey! Where were you doing that fight? Can’t you heal me?

John: O-ohhh right!

John comes over and treats my wounds with a combination of magic and herbal medicine. 

Alice: Let’s press on.

## Chapter 12
## Strategy talk

We continue to advance through the ruins and find a small river, surrounded by a bed of tiny white flowers. It seems like a good place to take a break, so we all sit down.

Yamamoto: Remember our battle strategy, everyone.

John: What was that again?

Yamamoto: Alice and Tanaka are in the front lines, attacking head on. Lee focuses on defending them from attack. John and I stay in the back. John heals as necessary, and I take shots with my gun when I get a clear hit.

John: I get to stay in the back? Awesome!

Alice: Your job is serious, you know. Don’t do anything stupid.

John: I will only do smart things.

Alice: I’m sure.

## Chapter 13
## The labyrinth door

We continue advancing through the labyrinth. Twisted corridors turn into more twisted corridors. It all looks the same to me. We’ve been exploring the labyrinth for hours, and it’s late afternoon now.

Eventually, we reach a great door at the end of a hallway. A pungent smell wafts through…

Alice: An interesting door, let’s go in.

Yamamoto: Wait.

Alice: What is it?

Yamamoto: It is late, and we are tired. We should head back to Maginia first. Who knows what is behind the door?

Alice: I’m not afraid. We can take it. Right, Tanaka?

Tanaka: If Alice says so, I’m sure we can do it!

Yamamoto: …

John: Mehhh why do we have to go today? If it’s a fight, it’ll be the same tomorrow.

Alice: Don’t complain, John.

Lee: If even one of our members is tired, I think it makes sense to go back. We can’t fight without all of us. Let’s respect Yamamoto’s wishes.

Alice: Good idea from Lee. Let’s head back.

## Chapter 14
## Vivian’s inn

It’s late when we get back to Maginia. We need to find an inn to stay in, which we neglected to do earlier. We try the big inn in town, but it’s full. Eventually we come across a small inn nestled in a corner of downtown. Even though it’s late at night, we can smell the scent of cake and pastries coming through the door.

John: Let’s try this one!

Alice: Rare good idea from John!

We knock on the door but no one answers. Cautiously, I open the door.

Alice: Hello? Is anyone there?

I look around the room. It’s cozy for sure. There’s a small reception area with a desk. But the room is also a kitchen, and various desserts are on a table. The room is intricately decorated, but most of the decor seems to be handmade. 

I notice a young woman sleeping at the reception desk with a cat on her head.

Alice: Um… hello?

Woman: Customers…! Welcomeeee… zzz….

Alice: This is an inn, right? Do you have rooms available?

Woman: Rooms? Oh right, rooms… we have rooms. How many do you need?

Alice: 5.

Woman: Coming right up… bon appetit…!

The woman stands up. Her eyes are still closed, like she’s still sleeping. And the cat it still on her head.

Vivian: I’m Vivian. Ask me for anything you need. Happy to help… any customers...

## Chapter 15
## Breakfast

Everyone feels completely refreshed after the night at Vivian’s inn. In the morning, she serves us a breakfast of omelette, salmon, yogurt, persimmon, and hot chocolate. Incredibly delicious.

Looking around the kitchen,it seems we are the only people staying at the inn.

Next, we head back into the labyrinth, following our map directly to the great door.

Alice: We’re ready?

Tanaka: Yes!

Lee: Yes

John: Probably!

Yamamoto: Yes.

## Chapter 16
## Humongous plant monster

We open the door and step into the room, and are immediately greeted by an overwhelming, horrific smell. A huge flower-like, plant-like monster towers before us. I can see another door behind it. It’s clear that door is the exit to the ruins. We walk towards the door cautiously, and the monster bristles. It seems like we have no choice but to fight.

The monster lashes out at us with its vines. Lee is there in the front row, holding his shield to defend.

I rush towards the monster with my signature move: mirage sword! I strike so fast and so furiously, it is almost like I am two people at once. Tanaka is behind me, following my every move with her flame sword. 

Lee is doing a good job distracting the monster and blocking its attacks. However, suddenly there is a new surprise: the monster emits a cloud of poisonous gas. All of us feel ourselves getting sick and weak.

Alice: John?! Where are you?!

John: Uh yes! Coming! 

John rushes to prepare an antidote and deliver it to each of us in turn. Meanwhile, the monster takes the opportunity to strike at us and deal a lot of damage.

Alice: John, healing, now!

John: I’m trying!

Suddenly, a gunshot rings out from Yamamoto’s rifle. The carefully aimed bullet strikes one of the monster’s arms, disabling it temporarily. With the monster lacking a means of attack, John has the opportunity to finish preparing medicine for everyone. Feeling a bit better, Tanaka and I rush the monster again and trade blows with it. We can see it is getting weaker, but we are getting weaker, too.

Another carefully aimed shot from Yamamoto takes out its legs. It falls over, stunned and unable to move.

Yamamoto: Now is your chance! Strike with your full strength!

But Tanaka and I are too tired to use our special techniques anymore. We manage a few more hits with our swords, but it’s not enough to finish the job. Soon the monster is on its feet again. Adrenaline coursing through its body, it seems stronger and fiercer than ever. It readies its arms to strike at us. Lee tries to rush to our defense, but he is also tired, and can’t keep up a solid guard. We trade hits, and feel ourselves getting damaged. John, too, seems to have run out of medicine and can’t heal us.

I kneel on the ground, tired. The monster prepares to attack. Suddenly, Yamamoto rushes to the front lines, and parries its attack with her rifle. She is wielding it like a staff, expertly blocking its attacks. She sees an opening and shoots it point-blank in the face. It collapses, dead.

Yamamoto: It is disposed of.

Tanaka: Thank goodness!

John: We survived…

Alice: … Good job everyone. Let’s go back to Maginia.

## Chapter 17
## Celebration

Tanaka: Party time!!

Having just won our first major battle, we’ve decided to hold a little celebration.

Alice: Where should we go for our party?

Tanaka: To a bar!!

Lee: I remember seeing a bar near Vivian’s Inn.

Tanaka: Let’s go!!

Alice: Fine by me.

With Lee’s good memory and sense of direction, we find the bar easily. We go inside. A man greets us:

Kuwashil: Customers, welcome! The name’s Kuwashil, and I’m the owner of this bar. What can I get for you?

Alice: We’re having a celebration! Please bring out lots of food and alcohol!

Kuwashil: Coming right up!

We receive various dishes and drinks, all of it delicious.

Tanaka: Everyone, I have something to say! To my new friends, I love you all so much! I’m looking forward to so many wonderful adventures with you all in the future!

Alice: Uh, Tanaka Sensei…

Tanaka: Rin! My name is Rin! We’re all best friends now, so no need to call me “Tanaka Sensei” anymore!

Alice: Right… Rin-san.

## Chapter 18
## Talking with John

Lee: John, you’re not having anything to drink?

John: Haha, well, I’m still only 20, so…

Lee: I see.

Tanaka: Hahaha, cute baby John!

John: I’m not a baby!

Lee: Say John, you’re a student, right?

John: Well, I was a student. A medical student. Now, I’m an adventurer medic!

Lee: And why did you decide to study medicine, out of curiosity?

John: Hmm, no real reason, I guess.

Alice: Med school is really hard and really expensive, isn’t it? You sure you didn’t have a reason?

John: Well… I guess it just seemed like the most straightforward thing to do at the time?

Alice: I can’t believe you sometimes!

Lee: Now you’re an adventurer though, and being an adventurer is definitely not the most straightforward thing to do. Why become an adventurer? Why quit school?

John: Hmm… no real reason I guess. School was boring. Hated tests.

Tanaka: Me too! I hate tests! There are not tests in my class!

John: Woah, really? I want to join Tanaka’s class!

Yamamoto: Wait a minute, John. You really had no reason to become an adventurer? You would put your life on the line for nothing?

John: Uh… well… I don’t know! Geez, what is this, an interview?

Lee: Please excuse me. I didn’t mean to pry into your personal life.

Yamamoto: It was a serious question, though…

Alice: Anyway, I’m sure there was nothing interesting. John’s personal life is probably really boring.

John: Hey, I’m really interesting! Let’s talk about your personal life, huh Alice? What’s in that journal of yours you’re always writing in? 

Alice: Nothing interesting! Let’s talk about something else!

## Chapter 19
## Talking with Kuwashil

Kuwashil: You guys, you’re adventurers, right?

Alice: That’s right! We’re new adventurers. We’re Kowagarijanai guild!

Kuwashil: Kowagarijanai? Gahahaha! Anyway, why don’t you tell me about your adventures so far? Where have you been?

Alice: We went to the ruins north of Maginia. We drew a map, here take a look.

Kuwashil: Woah nice! It’s a good map. Say, you guys, have you been the Exploration Headquarters yet?

Alice: Exploration Headquarters? No, what’s that?

Kuwashil: It’s the place where Princess Persephone manages exploration efforts for the city. She’s making an effort to study all the lands surrounding Maginia. 

Lee: Princess Persephone is the ruler of Maginia, isn’t she? She’s interested in things like adventurers and exploring?

Kuwashil: That’s right. This is a fairly remote location after all, largely unexplored by humans except for our small city. You can imagine how it would be useful for Maginia to learn more about the surrounding area. You guys should go pay her a visit. I bet she’d find your map useful. Did I mention, if she likes your guild, you might become famous all over the town? Ahahaha!

Alice: Let’s go.

## Chapter 20
## Persephone

Tanaka and I head to the exploration headquarters, a large palace-like building in the center of Maginia. Until we got there, I didn’t know it would be so grandiose -- evidently, it is a place of some import. I feel nervous approaching it.

At the palace gate, we find a guard.

Alice: Can we enter the palace? I’d like to speak with Princess Persephone. 

Guard: Go right ahead. The public is permitted to enter.

We enter and find ourselves in a grand room, with walls of gold and a high ceiling. The far end wall is almost entirely made up of a windows that gaze out over courtyard gardens. We see a regal-looking woman standing there, gazing out. We approach.

Alice: Um, hello? You must be Persephone-sama.

Persephone: Ah, a new face. Welcome. You are?

Alice: Alice Smith and Tanaka Rin. We represent Kowagarijanai guild.

Persephone: Kowagarijanai…? Cute… Anyway, what can I do for you?

Alice: We explored the ruins to the north. We defeated a monster guarding the exit, and we drew a map. I’d like to submit the map to the exploration headquarters, it should make it easier for other adventurers.

Tanaka hands over the map.
Persephone: It is a very good map. Detailed and rigorous. Thank you, this will aid our exploration efforts immensely.

After looking over the map for some time, Persephone turns her attention to Alice and Tanaka.

Persephone: Young one, what is the goal of your guild?

Alice: We will find the magical treasure of Yggdrasil, and save the world.

Persephone: Is that so…? In that case, you are probably going to the Verdant Forest next, correct?

Alice: Yes, that is the direction we are going.

Persephone: In that case, I have an official request for you. Please map the forest for us, as well. It is a very dangerous area. It will help our exploration efforts a lot to have a great map. It will also help us if you catalog animals and plants you discover along the way. Rest assured, you will be compensated for your efforts. Though do be aware… the Verdant Forest is quite dangerous.

Alice: We accept this task.

Persephone: Excellent.

Alice and Tanaka turn to leave.

Persephone: By the way, what was the name of your guild, again?

Alice: Kowagarijanai!

Persephone: Kowagarijanai… okay. I won’t forget it. Be careful out there.

## Chapter 21
## The Verdant Forest

Continuing our adventure, we arrive in a magnificent sea of trees. They call this place the Verdant Forest, so thick with trees, shrubs, and all manners of plant life that it is like a labyrinth. Despite the density of the vegetation, light manages to shine through all the way to the forest floor, giving the whole area a bright, glowing appearance.

We traverse the forest labyrinth’s twisting paths, making sure to keep our map up-to-date. Along the way, we encounter several small monsters we need to fight, such as Violent Baboons, Mandrakes, and Ghost Owls. However, they do not give us much trouble.

## Chapter 22
## Mysterious fruit

We reach a dead end of a path through the forest. Here, I see a tree with a large, red fruit. I remember Princess Persephone told us to document the plants we come across, so…

Alice: Hey everyone, look, there is an interesting fruit.

Without any more prompting, Lee climbs the tree, grabs the fruit, and tosses it down to me.

Alice: Nice one, Lee!

The fruit is emitting a nice, sweet smell.

Tanaka: Looks tasty, and I’m hungry! Can we eat it, Alice?

Alice: Hmm… I’m not sure… Is it safe?

I’m not exactly a botanist, and I don’t know anything about what kinds of fruits are safe to eat.

John: This fruit is called Ruby Grapple… I think. I learned about it in botany class.

Alice: Oh, you did? Is it edible?

John: I don’t remember. Must have slept through that part of class, haha.

Alice: ...You never fail to disappoint me, John.

Lee: I have a strong stomach. I’ll try it.

Lee takes a bite.

Lee: It’s really good actually! My body feels energized. Everyone, let’s share it!

Tanaka: Woohoo!

Alice: Awesome! Thanks, Lee!

## Chapter 23
## Campfire chat with Lee
We spend the whole day traveling through the sea of trees. It’s getting dark, but we are far from Maginia and don’t want to head back. We decide to camp for the night.

We set up a campfire and sit around it. We do our best to cook dinner using ingredients we collected during the day: fruits and vegetables we found, as well as meat from monsters. Both John and Lee are surprisingly adept at cooking. Me, not so much.

Over dinner, we get to talking.

Tanaka: Hey, Lee!! Question!!

Lee: Yes?

Tanaka: You told us you were a traveler, and you have been on many adventures, right? Please tell us about your adventures.

Lee: Of course! Hmm, where to start…?

Tanaka: How about you tell us why you are wearing a pirate outfit, Lee? I mean, it’s a cool look and all, but is there a story behind it?

Lee: Oh, that. A short while ago, I was sailing with some ghost pirates. While we were sailing across the ocean, I saw the World Tree in the distance, and decided I had to check it out. That’s how I came to Maginia.

Alice: Uh… what? Ghost pirates?

Lee: Yeah. They’re more friendly than you might think, actually!

Alice: Is that so…?

Tanaka: Cool! How did you meet the ghost pirates?

Lee: Oh, that. Well, I was stranded on a deserted island, and I couldn’t figure out how to leave. Then, I found a portal to the spirit realm. I made friends with some ghosts there, and they were able to send a ghost ship to pick me up and get me off the island.

Tanaka: Wow…! What was it like being stranded on a deserted island...? 

Lee: It was interesting learning how to survive on basically nothing.

Alice: And how did you end up stranded on a deserted island?

Lee: Oh that. I was flying on a dragon over the ocean, but then we got attacked by an imperial airship that was chasing the dragon. I fell into the ocean, and washed ashore on the island.

Alice: You made friends with a dragon?! What?!

Lee: Oh, that. I was trying to steal its treasure, but then it caught me red-handed. However, I explained the the reason I wanted to steal the treasure was so that I could get money to buy medicine for someone else. It appreciated my honesty, so we became friends.

Tanaka: Wow, so many adventures!

Alice: Lee is so cool, huh?

John: Wow, you’re crazy, man.

## Chapter 24
## Oliver and Marco

The next day, we continue our traversal through the forest. Eventually, we come to a wide clearing. We see two men standing there, looking lost. One of the men is wearing a suit of armor and carrying a sword and shield. The other is dressed like a mage. They seem to be adventurers.

Alice: Greetings. I’m Alice Smith, and this is Kowagarijanai guild. We’re adventurers from Maginia.

The man with armor with armor speaks. 

Oliver: Howdy! We’re adventurers from Maginia too. My name’s Oliver, and this here’s my partner, Marco!

Marco: Nice to meet you.

Oliver: Say kid, you’re pretty young. What made you want to become an adventurer? Fame? Thrills? As for me, I’m in it for money. Gotta feed the family somehow, you know?

Marco: And I’m in it for knowledge. There are so many unknown plants and creatures out there to learn.

Alice: I’m trying to save the world.

Oliver: Gahaha that’s a new one! But hey, I like your style, kid. Here, take this ore. Marco and I collected a bunch of ore while exploring. It’s useful for marking weapons and armor, you know!

Oliver gives me some ore.

Alice: Wow, thank you! That’s so kind.

Oliver: It’s nothing!

Marco: It’s prudent for adventurers to watch each other’s backs in this dangerous world. We’re all in this together.

Alice: That’s right, isn’t it? Here, I’ll help you too. Take a look at this map of the forest we’ve been making.

Oliver: Woahhhh a map! That would be really useful! This place certainly is a labyrinth, isn’t it?

Alice: Why not make a copy?

Marco copies the map dutifully.

Marco: Why didn’t I think of making a map? Anyway, thank you very much!

Alice: Happy to help! Hope to see you guys again around!

And with that, we part ways.

## Chapter 25
## Napier’s shop

After another day in the labyrinth, we decide to head back to Maginia. I show the map we’ve made to Persephone, and she seems pleased. She pays us a considerable sum of money, and recommends we use it to improve our adventuring equipment. She recommends a shop in downtown Maginia run by a woman named Napier.

I decide to go to Napier’s shop alone, and I tell everyone else they have the day off. 

Entering Napier’s shop, I find it to be richly decorated. Suits of armor and weapons line the walls. In the corner, I can see medicines and other strange foods.

Napier: Welcome, customer. Napier speaking. New adventurer, are you?

Alice: That’s right. I’ve brought money and some ore. I’d like to make some new equipment, and buy some medicine.

Napier: As you wish!

Napier produces new armor and weapons for everyone in the guild.

Alice: Thank you very much. This will really help us explore the Verdant Forest.

Napier: You’re exploring the Verdant Forest, are you? Actually, can you do a request for me? Could you collect some mint grass for me? I’ll use it to make medicine to sell in the shop. I’ll pay you for your efforts, of course. It maybe be a little difficult to find, but...

Alice: Leave it to Kowagarijanai guild! We can do it!

Napier: Oh...? Good luck then.

## Chapter 26
## Tanaka and Yamamoto

While Alice is buying supplies at Napier’s shop, the rest of Kowagarijanai guild has the day off. Let’s see what Tanaka and Yamamoto are up to.

Yamamoto: Rin-san, drinks?

Tanaka: Yes!

Tanaka and Yamamoto visit the bar downtown and get to talking.

Yamamoto: Rin, you are a seasoned hero… but I want you to be careful.

Tanaka: Don’t worry about me! Let’s talk about something else. What drink did you get Emika-chan?

Yamamoto: I mean seriously. Listen to me for a second.

Tanaka: ?

Yamamoto: I know our guild is on a quest to save the world, and that’s very important… but your individual life is important too. Never forget that.

Tanaka: Right…

Yamamoto: This girl, Alice. She is still very green. Do not blindly follow her. You are her teacher, use your own wisdom sometime.

Tanaka: Hmm… She is the guild leader though.

Yamamoto: Do not hesitate to rebel against and unwise ruler.

Tanaka: You sound like my husband, haha. I get your point. If we’re going to get out of this labyrinth, we all need to be using our own strengths. Let’s work together to conquer this labyrinth!

Yamamoto: Good. That’s the Rin-san I remember. 

## Chapter 27
## John and Lee

John and Lee are having tea and talking at Vivian's Inn.

John: Hey Lee, what do you think of the girls in our guild?

Lee: Alice has a lot of will, although some insecurity as well. I think if we support her, she can be a strong leader. Tanaka is very friendly, although she seems to ill-suited to play sidekick to Alice. She is older, but doesn’t it seem like she sees herself as inferior to Alice? Yamamoto I can’t really figure out. She seems to be hiding something, and definitely knows more than she lets on. I don’t know what her goals are.

John: Nah man, I meant, what do you think of them as women, you know? Isn’t Yamamoto really pretty? And Tanaka is so cute. And Alice is totally sexy. We’ve got the whole spectrum covered -- it’s great, don’t you think!

Lee: Ah, that sort of thing. Well… Alice kind of reminds me of my ex-wife I guess?

John: Your ex-wife?! You’re already married?

Lee: Yeah, well, it was an accident. 

John: I gotta hear this story.

Lee: So, it was one year ago. I had to fight this evil god to save the world, and…

John: You fought a god?!

Lee: Yeah. Anyway, as I was saying. I had to fight this god, but I wasn’t strong enough, since I’m a mortal. Then my friend, Princess Yumiko…

John: Princess??!

Lee: Yeah. Anyway, as I was saying, my friend Princess Yumiko gave me a magical ring with divine power strong enough to defeat the god. I took the ring and beat the god. However, I didn’t realize that accepting the ring was a sign of marriage in Yumiko’s kingdom. As soon as I realized that, I divorced her.

John: Why?? She wasn’t sexy enough?

Lee: It’s not like that. I did like her. But it was an accident, and I wasn’t ready for that sort of thing, you know?

John: You’re crazy, man. If I were you, I totally would have married her.

Lee: Really now…?

## Chapter 28
## Collecting

We return to our Verdant Forest exploration. I remember that Napier, the merchant from town, asked me to look for a plant called mint grass.

Alice: John, have you heard of mint grass? You took a botany class, right?

John: Sounds familiar, but I don’t remember it!

Alice: What good is this botany class…?

Lee: I know mint grass. I used it to make medicine once, on a previous adventure. It has thin, light blue leaves, a small white flowers.

John: Oh I remember it now!

Alice: Thank you Lee, helpful as always. Everyone, let’s keep an eye out for it.

## Chapter 29
## Tanaka’s old sword

As we travel through the forest, we encounter monsters that we have to fight. After a fight with a particularly strong owl monster, Tanaka pulls me aside.

Tanaka: Alice, a word!

Alice: Yes?

Tanaka: About your sword…

The sword I am using used to belong to Tanaka, long ago, back when she was a hero. She gave it to me after I succeeded her as our town’s hero.

Tanaka: Alice, you are very skilled with that sword. However, you haven’t been using that sword’s full power, you know.

Alice: Full power? What do you mean?

Tanaka: That sword is magic. It can conjure fire, ice, and electricity. You should try it.

Alice: Uh, how do I do that?

Tanaka: It’s a secret.

Alice: Uh, a secret? You’re not going to tell me?

Tanaka: Actually, I just forgot. Maybe try concentrating really hard or something?

Alice: You forgot…?

Anyway, I give it my best try, focusing my thoughts onto the sword. Suddenly, ice bursts from the sword in a small explosion.

Tanaka: Woohoo, nice job Alice!

Alice: I can’t seem to make fire or electricity. Only ice…

Tanaka: Maybe because your heart is just ice?

Alice: H-hey!

Tanaka: Anyway, it’s a good start for now! I hope the ice power serves you well!

## Chapter 30
## FOE

We continue our travels through the forest, going deeper into the labyrinth. It’s getting late in the day, and we’ve been walking in silence for a while. Suddenly, I notice something.

Alice: Where is John?

Tanaka: I haven’t seen him in a while, that’s weird. 

Lee: Sorry, I didn’t notice either…

Yamamoto: Me either…

Alice: Hmm… Did that idiot wander off on his own? You all wait here! I’ll go look for him.

I run off into the forest by myself before anyone has a chance to say anything.

Tracking John turns out to be easy. He has left a trail through the grass that is clear to follow. I walk along the trail, then gradually turn to running.

Soon enough, down a narrow corridor of trees, I spot him. He’s standing, frozen in place, a huge monster looming in front of him. It looks like some kind of gigantic bear, but with massive claws.

Alice: John!!

John: …

John doesn’t turn back to face me. Instead, his eyes remain fixed on the monster.

Alice: What is that thing…?

John: Seems to be a FOE… Never thought I’d actually meet one…

Alice: A FOE?!

FOE is the name for extremely powerful monsters that roam the labyrinths. Far too strong for most adventurers to fight, it is recommended that you evade or run from them.

The FOE advances on John, raising its claws to strike.

Alice: Run away!

John: …

Alice: What the hell, John!!

I run up and stand in front of John, between him and the FOE. As it strikes with its claws, I raise my shield to defend us. My shield shatters on impact, but manages to deflect the blow and momentarily knock the FOE off balance.

Alice: Come on, let’s run!!

John: …

I grab John’s arm and pull. He seems to snap to his senses and we start running. The FOE charges after us, closely following.

Alice: Damn it, I’m not sure if we can outrun it…

They turn a corner, and another corner. The FOE keeps following us.

Alice: And we don’t have the map either. I hope we don’t hit a dead-end…

John: There, off to the side! A door! FOE aren’t able to get through them!

Alice: Wha-, seriously?

We turn off the path and head straight for the door. We slip through and shut it behind us. The FOE crashes into the door, but cannot get through. We stay silent on the other side of the door. After a moment, the FOE gives up and wanders away.

Alice: What were you thinking, running off on your own?? 

John won’t look me in the eyes.

John: …

Alice: Answer me!

John: …

Alice: Be serious! You know it’s dangerous to travel the labyrinth alone! That’s why we travel in a guild.

A hint of a smile appears on John’s face.

John:...Then where are the others? Why’d you come after me by yourself?

Alice: That’s all you have to say? You’re talking back to me, after I saved you? Unbelievable.

John: …

Alice: Whatever. Let’s go back to the others.

John: Wait a sec, on the ground…

I look down and see a kind of grass with light blue leaves.

Alice: It’s mint grass, huh? Let’s collect some then, and head back.

## Chapter 31
## The red-haired bear king

dvancing into the depths of the Verdant Forest, we come to a large door. A guard from Maginia is stationed in front.

Alice: Hello, what’s this?

Guard: Beyond this door lies the dominion of the red-haired bear king. It is an extremely dangerous and wily beast that has killed many adventurers from Maginia. Some guards and other adventurers are inside, fighting it right now.

Alice: We can help.

Guard: I cannot allow you to enter without written permission from exploration headquarters. Go speak to Princess Persephone if you would like to help.

We return to Maginia and meet with Persephone.

Persephone: Ah, Kowagarijanai. I see you have made a lot of progress on your map. Thank you.

Alice: We wanted to ask you for permission to fight the red-haired bear king.

Persephone: Oh that? It is too dangerous for new adventurers. You are most useful making maps and collecting ingredients. This bear king has killed many adventurers and people from Maginia.

Alice: I’m a hero. My job is to protect people. If something is terrorizing the people, I want to help.

Persephone: Very well then. I grant you permission. Be careful, though. If it’s too dangerous, come back.

## Chapter 32
## Delivery to Napier

Before we head off to fight the bear king, I stop by Napier’s shop to deliver the mint grass we collected.

Alice: Hello, Napier. I brought the mint grass you asked us to collect.

Napier: Oh you did? Thank you. This will help the shop a lot. Here’s a reward for your troubles.

Napier gives me 10000 yen.

Napier: What was the name of your guild, again?

Alice: We’re Kowagarijanai! Happy to be of service!

Napier: Kowagarijanai, eh? If you’re a new guild, it helps to get your name out there, right? I’ll tell other people in Maginia about your help. Maybe you’ll receive more requests from people.

Alice: Thank you very much!

## Chapter 33
## In the dominion of the bear king

We return to the door in the Verdant Forest. We see the guard by the door. Also there are Oliver and Marco, the other adventurers we encountered earlier in the labyrinth.

Alice: Hello, Oliver and Marco! What are you doing here?

Oliver: We’re hunting the red-haired bear king, on a mission from the exploration headquarters.

Alice: Same with us. Good luck out there.

Oliver: Good luck to you too!

Guard: Everyone, please be careful. Be aware, the red-haired bear king is quite intelligent, and a rather tricky beast...

We enter the door. We go in a different direction from Oliver and Marco.

We cautiously advance through the forest. Everyone is silent, it seems everyone’s nerves are on edge.

Tanaka: How is everyone doing?

No one responds.

Tanaka: Not gonna lie, I’m a little scared, myself.

Alice: I guess I am too.

It feels good to admit it.

Tanaka: Let’s devise an exit strategy, in case we have to run.

Alice: Good idea, Rin-san. Hmm… what should we do?

Lee: I have good defense, so I can distract it while you all run away.

Alice: What will you do, then?

Lee: I’ll climb the trees and escape that way. 

Alice: Nice…

The plan makes everyone feel a bit better, and we now advance through the forest with more confidence. Eventually, we come to a fork in the road. We stop to consider which way to go.

Alice: Hmm, which way should we go?

Before we can decide, however, Yamamoto suddenly cries out: 

Yamamoto: Look out behind you!!

I turn around. A moment later, a massive red bear comes leaping down upon us from a tree, and swipes a massive claw at us. But Lee is there, blocking the hit.

Alice: Everyone, ready to fight!

## Chapter 34
## Vs. the red-haired bear king

We do battle with the red-haired bear king. We stick to our roles, and the battle isn’t too hard. Tanaka and I are in the front lines, doing damage. Lee defends us. John heals. Yamamoto in the back row with her gun. Eventually, after a long battle, the bear king collapses, defeated.

We are tired, but victorious.

John: It’s done? That was easy!

Tanaka: I guess our skills at fighting are improving. Good job everyone!

Alice: Let’s head back to Maginia and inform Princess Persephone of our victory.

We begin the journey back to Maginia. We pass by the door, but the guard isn’t there. That’s odd…

Tanaka: Ahh!

We spot two people laying on the ground, bleeding.  It’s the adventurers we met earlier, Oliver and Marco! I rush over to them.

Marco tries to say something…

Marco: Be careful... Bear... king...

Alice: Huh? But…

Suddenly there is a crashing noise behind us, and the bear king leaps out from behind a bushes, attacking with its claws. 

Alice: What??

We launch into battle again, but we are all tired.

Yamamoto: Alice, we can’t win this fight! We should withdraw!

Alice: But…!

Lee: We can’t waste too much time here, with Oliver and Marco wounded. We should prioritize getting them back to Maginia.

Tanaka: Agreed with Lee!

Alice: Okay, let’s run!

Lee does his best to distract the bear king. Yamamoto and I carry Oliver and Marco on our backs, and we make a run for it.

## Chapter 35
## Report on the bear king

Everyone makes it back to Maginia safely. We tell Princess Persephone about our encounter with the bear king.

Alice: We thought we had killed it, but it was only playing dead.

Persephone: Concerning. It is quite intelligent…

Suddenly, a guard rushes in.

Guard: Princess Persephone! A report! We’ve tracked the bear king’s movements, and it has retreated even deeper into the forest.

Persephone: Deeper…? Hmm…

Alice: We did wound it severely. Perhaps it needs to retreat and recover, too. We should return and finish it off while we have the chance.

Persephone: Perhaps… I have a bad feeling about this. However, we cannot allow it to grow more aggressive and attack more of Maginia's people. If you feel up to it, once you’ve rested, you have permission to keep hunting it.

Alice: We’ll do it!

## Chapter 36
## Rematch with the bear king

We return to the Verdant Forest and travel deeper in. As we go further, the trees thicken, and it becomes darker. Lee takes out his lantern so we can all see.

After traveling through several narrow passageways, we suddenly come to a large clearing. We can see the bear king standing at the far end of the clearing.

Alice: There it is, just waiting there…

Yamamoto: Wait, this is a trap. Do not go straight across the clearing. There are other bears waiting in ambush. 

Alice: Huh, how do you know?

Lee: It makes sense. Princess Persephone mentioned that the bear king is an intelligent and tricky one. Not to mention that it tricked us already. I don’t think it would just wait there for us so easily. Let’s sneak around behind it, and ambush it instead.

Alice: Okay, makes sense.

We sneak through the trees around the perimeter of the clearing. Sure enough, we see other bears lying in ambush, but we are able to evade them. Eventually, we come up behind the bear king.

Alice: Everyone ready?

We launch a surprise attack on the bear king. Everything goes according to plan, and after a long fight, we defeat it.

It’s a long fight, but we manage to win. This time we make sure it is dead.

Tanaka: Woohoo! We finally beat it!

John: That was too hard! Can’t believe we had to fight it twice…

Lee: What an adventure though! The victory is even sweeter after the struggle.

Alice: Excellent work everyone! Let’s report our success to Persephone. The name of Kowagarijanai guild will be known as the heroes of Maginia!

## Chapter 37
## Cernunnos

Alice: Good job defeating the bear king everyone! Let’s return to Maginia.

We are about to head back when Yamamoto suddenly cries out.

Yamamoto: Everyone, look out behind you!

Everyone turns around. A moment later, and humongous figure comes crashing down out of the sky, shaking the ground as it lands in fronts of us.

Alice: Wh-what is that?!

I take a look at the massive being standing before us. It is some kind of giant beast, about 10 meters tall, standing on two legs. It has the head of a stag, with massive horns. It is wearing armor, with golden rings around its hands and feet.

Lee: That… is no ordinary animal, that’s for sure.

I look over my teammates. Everyone is tired from our battle with the bear king. Yamamoto has a particularly pained expression on her face.

Alice: Are we supposed to fight this thing?

As it to answer my question, the beast charges at me with such speed and power that it rips up the ground below it as it runs. I stand, frozen, not sure what to do. I’ve never fought anything like this before…

Yamamoto: Hey!

A powerful blast from Yamamoto’s guns hits the creature’s feet, tripping it up briefly. A moment later, it recovers, and charges a ball of energy in its arms, which it throws at us, causing an explosion. All of us are hit and get scattered.

Tanaka: Alice, what do we do? This thing is way too strong for us to fight! And it doesn’t look like we can escape, either…

Alice: I… I don’t know. I’m sorry everyone…

The beast puts its hands together and starts charging another energy blast.

Yamamoto: Everyone, listen to me! I know it looks hard, but we can win this! First, concentrate on dodging its energy attack in the next 5 seconds!

The monster its energy blast, and we all jump out of the way. I draw my sword to counterattack.

Yamamoto: Alice, do not rush in an attack! Wait to recover your strength, wait for the creature to become vulnerable, then strike together with Tanaka with your full might! 

Alice and Tanaka: Okay!

The monster charges at us again. Lee leaps in to defend us, however…

Yamamoto: Lee, put down your shield! There is no need to defend against this attack!

Lee: Huh?

Lee drops his shield, and the monster charges into us. We take the hit, but it isn’t too bad.

Yamamoto: Lee, if you defend all the time, you will become tired. You need to save your strength, and only defend at the critical moments. Alice and Tanaka will be vulnerable when they are attacking, so defend them then!

Lee: Understood!

For a moment, the creature stands still, and looks vulnerable. Tanaka and I get ready to strike.

Yamamoto: Wait! It is about to erect a barrier that will counter your attacks!

Alice: Huh?

We stop and watch the creature. It stands still, and a magic barrier appears in front of it.

Yamamoto: It won’t attack us now, so John, please take the opportunity to heal everyone’s wounds!

John: On it!

John scurries around and heals everyone.

A minute later, the barrier disappears.

Alice: Now!

Tanaka and I rush in and attack it, with Lee backing us up. We strike hard, but the creature seems barely hurt.

Yamamoto: Good job! Retreat for a moment, and we’ll do that again in a minute!

The battle continues like this pattern for a while. The monster attacks us, and we take the hit. The monster puts up its barrier, and John heals us. Then we rush in and attack.

An hour later, the fight continues on. We are getting tired, but we can see the monster getting tired too.

Alice: It’s almost done! One more good attack should finish it…

Yamamoto: Wait, Alice, I need you to save your strength for something else. Please ready your most powerful attack, but don’t use it yet.

Alice: Huh? Uh, okay!

A moment later, the beast lets out a roar. Then, smaller monsters emerge from the trees and approach. Then the smaller monsters start healing the big monster’s wounds!

Yamamoto: Alice, quickly take out the small monsters before they heal it!

I use my special move: Mirage sword! I rush at the small monsters with blinding speed, striking so quickly and so ferociously it’s like I am in two places at once. I take them out immediately. Then I am so tired, I fall to the ground.

Yamamoto: Okay, it’s almost done now! Tanaka, finish it off!

Tanaka: On it!

Suddenly, however, the great beast turns its attention to Yamamoto. It gazes directly at her, seemingly having figured out that she is calling the shots. Yamamoto gazes directly back at it. Then, completely ignoring the rest of us, the beast charges straight at Yamamoto. Lee tries to defend her, but the monster grabs him and throws him aside, knocking him out, Then it punches Yamamoto head on, sending her flying, and knocking her out, too.

Tanaka: No, Yamamoto!

Tanaka runs over to Yamamoto.

Alice: Wait... Tanaka! Help Yamamoto later! For now, you have to finish this fight quickly, or none of us will survive…!

Tanaka: Ah, right…!

Tanaka turns to face the monster. With the last of her strength, she imbues her sword with fire magic, and attacks the beast. 

Tanaka: Flame sword!!

There is a great flash of light as Tanaka’s flame sword slices across the monster. With a loud cry, it crashes to the ground, defeated. Tanaka collapses in exhaustion.

Then, finally, the forest is silent.

John, the only one left standing, rushes around to all of us, administering first aid. With some crude medicine, he manages to revive Lee and me. We carry Tanaka and Yamamoto back to Maginia.
