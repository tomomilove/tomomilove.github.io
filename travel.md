# On the world stage

## Tokyo

I didn't think I'd like a big city so much, but actually, I liked Tokyo quite a bit. Thoughts on some places we visited:

First we went to Asakusa, home of Bad Cat. It's touristy, maybe, but I think if you follow Bad Cat's advice and pay attention, you'll find a certain richness there.

We also went to the nearby Skytree. Thank you for convincing me to go up, because honestly, it was one of the highlights of the trip for me. Being up so high, I was able to get a real sense of just how massive Tokyo is, and that gave me a new kind of appreciation for it that I wouldn't have gotten otherwise. Just traveling by subway here and there, you don't really get a sense of the city you're going through.

Then we went to Waseda University. What a great surprise stumbling into the student film festival! I thought this was nice because it was beyond typical touristy experiences, since we got to see what kinds of things normal people in Tokyo have on their minds. I thought the film we saw was interesting. It didn't have much of a plot or resolution or anything, but for some reason it has stuck with me, and I still think about the relationships it presented.

We also spent some time in Ginza. It's fanciness was impressive, but for that reason I didn't feel all that comfortable there. Nice to visit though, and I definitely appreciate the warabi mochi we got there!

The imperial palace wasn't a very interesting place to visit on our trip, but I appreciate it for being a quiet space in the middle of the bustling city. Actually, I imagine if I lived in Tokyo, I would hang out there quite a lot.

Shibuya, I was surprised by just how bustling it was, even at night. Prior to our trip I had heard that Shibuya was a busy place, and I guess I'm surprised that this turned out to actually be the case! 

## Plane flight

Our flight to Japan was truly the unluckiest of flights. Delayed 7 hours, and they ran out of food by the time they reached our seats. Not to mention that the person sitting behind us had a medical emergency. At least we all made it through safely, eventually. 

There wasn't a whole lot we can do about that. Though, if I have one takeaway from the experience, it's to book tickets and choose seats earlier. Next time I'll try really hard to avoid sitting in the very back rows, if only to avoid missing out on food again. 

## Bordeaux

Bordeaux is such a beautiful city. It's so nice just to wander the twisting downtown streets, gander at the cathedrals and architecture, or just hang out at the water mirror. Everywhere you go just seems so friendly. I'm jealous of you getting to spend so much time there. I wish I had an opportunity to get to know it better myself, it really seems like a place I could be comfortable in.

## Davis

I've heard many people call Davis a boring town, but it will always be special to me. It's the place I grew up, a place where, as a kid, my imagination ran wild. A place where, as a kid, I watched for shooting stars to wish for love. You laugh at me for liking that UFO statue, but for me, I think of it as a symbol of Davis. It's a statue that suggests that something myesterious, something magical could happen happen in the ordinary town of Davis. In a way it represents my dreams as a kid, stuck in that small town.
 
Something interesting is that, to this day, when I think of what society and culture I feel most a part of, I don't think of American culture, or even Californian culture; I think of Davis culture specifically. It's got an emphasis on education and intellectualism, but with a simpleness and a slowness that you don't get in the Bay Area. Add in an appreciation of the outdoors, an appreciation of good food, and just a little bit of crazy, and I think that sums up Davis culture pretty well.

## Berkeley

I think of Berkeley as one center of world culture, a great crossroads where interesting people meet (including you and me!).

I grew up in Davis, and you grew up in San Jose, due to the choices of our parents (or from our perspective, essentially the hand of fate). But Berkeley was a place we both chose to go of our own will, and that is where we met. In other words, I think our meeting was not so much determined by chance, but rather by our own choices. I think that's interesting, the way in which some meetings seem to be a result of chance, and others not.

I'll always remember Berkeley as the place I grew up. I came into Berkeley foolish and weak, and left it competent but humbled. I'll always remember the mistakes I made there. I'll remember the painful, painful lessons I learned about interacting with other people there. How other people can be so strange and incomprehensible at times, but how this is perfectly okay, and you should still treat them with gentleness.
