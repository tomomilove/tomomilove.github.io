## Blue sky day
I took the day off, so we decided to visit Berkeley!

We decided to ride the Amtrak there. It was quite nice, actually! The Amtrak is alot more comfortable than Caltrain and BART. The one troublesome part is having to walk from the Amtrak station to downtown Berkeley. However, that's not so bad. If it were me, I'd go by Amtrak again next time!

Our first stop was lunch at Angeline's.

I got the gumbo, and you got the fried chicken. It was a bit heavy for the first meal of the day, but at least for me, I thought it ended up a good choice. It sustained me well throughout the day!

Next, you showed me a cool little library that could be found inside the main library. I never knew it was there! How did you find it? 

Here's a cool tiger that I saw in that library:

Next, we went up to the hill behind Clark Kerr. There we saw an incredibly blue sky. I'm not sure why, but it seemed bluer to me than I have ever seen before. Maybe the air was particularly clear up there, or maybe I was just paying more attention than usual. Either way, I was impressed with its beauty, and I felt so happy that I could share the moment with you.

After that, we took a trip to Asha, and picked up dinner at Suya for the train ride home.

I can only speak for myself, but I had a wonderful day with you. Please take a piece of this day and put it in your perfect day bottle, for me.

## Per's words
I started reading _The Book of Japanese Tea_ by Per Oscar Brekell.

The first thing I noticed is that the author has quite a curious first name. It is so short, I wasn't even sure it was a name at first. I'm actually still not sure. In Japanese, it just says his name is ブレクル・オスカル, so it omits the "Per" part. I'm not sure what that means, is Per like a title or something?

Anyway, in the book, it mentions that Per was born in Sweden and moved to Japan in his college age to pursue his passion with tea. That's pretty intense if you ask me. I like tea well enough myself, but I'm not sure it would be a deciding reason for me to move to another country.

What is it that he likes so much about tea, anyway? Here is his reason, in his own words:

"In Japan, the saying _shichu no sankyo_ or _mountain dwelling in the city_ [...means that] even if located in a noisy urban environment, [tea] would would carry our thoughts away to a quiet and secluded life deep in the mountains, thereby creating a space where our minds can be liberated from the strains and struggles of everyday life."

That doesn't sound too bad, actually. I am in pursuit of that kind of peace, myself.

Some of Per's words can become a bit dramatic. Here's another line from him:

"In countries other than Japan [...] there is a tendency to emphasize the health benefits rather than the taste and flavor of the tea. Of course, I too believe that drinking green tea promotes good health. However, rather than drinking Japanese tea to prolong one's life, I would like to think of it as something that makes our time on earth richer and more enjoyable."

Despite the kind of dramatic writing style, I think I can agree with that as well.

## Food truck mania!
So I discovered that a food trucks comes to Milk Pail every Wednesday. I wasn't able to make it the past two weeks, but I made sure to try it out this week!

The first thing I noticed is that this food truck ("The Meating Spot") is not the one that was here the previous week. That one was a Mexican food truck. I was really looking forward to trying that one, but I decided to give this one a shot anyway.

It was some kind of vaguely Asian themed food.

To be honest, it wasn't very good! Overall, it was just very basic. Some rice, some kimchi, and some chicken with sauce over lettuce. And the rice was pretty hard and not tasty. It's too bad this one is no good. I hope the Mexican truck is back next week and that I'll get to try that one.

I did realize one thing though: I sure am eating at a lot of food trucks lately! There is this one, and the other one by Target, and also I like to go to the food trucks at work for lunch! Maybe I should give it a rest!

## Mega Man 11

One of the first games I ever played was Mega Man 2.

![Mega Man 2 water](https://gonintendo.com/system/stories/promo_images/000/240/582/original/mega_man_2.jpg?1439656909)

This is a genre of game known as platformer. Essentially, your goal is to run, jump, and shoot your way to the end of the level.

I first played Mega Man 2 around 20 years ago, and even at the time, the game was old. The game was originally released in 1988.

Anyway, the series is still going, and today they released Mega Man 11, which I decided to buy.

The graphics have improved a little bit, but otherwise, it's very much the same type of game it was 30 years ago. I guess that's a part of the charm, though.

## One-Pan Coconut Chicken Curry _with Sweet Potatoes and Bok Choy_
Here's a new Blue Apron recipe I made.

![Coconut curry chicken](/images/blog_october/coconut_curry_chicken.jpg)

It was supposed to be curry... but all the liquid of the curry disappeared. I think it was a combination of me accidentally boiling it away and the sweet potatoes absorbing the rest.

As for the recipe, it was all right. Sweet potatoes are always good, and they go decently with the curry flavor. As for the bok choy, it felt like it was barely there. It shrunk a lot during cooking and I didn't really notice it while eating. At least it's healthy, though?

The chicken I overcooked slightly, but it wasn't bad!
