## Visiting parents

Today I came to visited my parents for Christmas. It is just me visiting this time! Not even my sister is here! That's a bit tough, actually.

We had lunch downtown at the Indian restaurant. I try to always go there when I'm in Davis. I wish I could make chai as good as they make there!

Then at home we sat around the Christmas tree for a while.

Could there be something for you under there...?

After that, my mom wanted to watch a movie. We watched Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (the first one, not the sequel). It takes place in the Harry Potter universe, but it doesn't quite feel like Harry Potter. I thought it leaned a bit too heavily into the typical Hollywood movie formula, and perhaps could have been made a bit more unique.

## Visiting you

Today I visited you and we had a really fun time!

We started off by viewing the Christmas decorations downtown... some of them were a little scary/ugly though!

Then we got cake!

![Downtown cake](/images/blog_december/downtown_cake.jpg)

After that we visited your house! First we visited with your Mom and your brother's dog. Then your other siblings slowly started showing up, and your brother's fiancee, too! We had some intense video game matches, especially playing Bomberman! It was nice being in such a full house. I am not often around that many people all so friendly!

Your brother's dog is so funny. She likes licking so much! You can't even pet her because she will just try to lick you. I wondered if she was okay with all the noise and people though. We got a little rowdy playing games, I wondered if it bothers her? It is hard to tell, I can never be sure what a dog is thinking.

## Quiet days at work

Not many people around today, and many services shutting down. For example, there was no milk tea today!

I wasn't able to get a lot done today, myself. Because I need other people to review my work, but they aren't here. That's fine with me, though! I just didn't work very hard.

My roommate was pretty excited for today, because it's his last day until vacation. H he said it's the first vacation where he can be totally disconnected from work since 2015. I told him he should do that once per year, he said he'd consider it!

## More coloring

Today I colored this card to send to our friends in Sacramento, along with the chocolate:

![Coloring postcard](/images/blog_december/coloring_postcard.jpg)

The color scheme looks a bit similar to the one I made for you recently. I guess I wasn't feeling too creative. I thought the blue crosses kind of looked like snowflakes, though, reflecting the season!

## Daily milk tea

I think I mentioned earlier that my new building at work promised to have milk tea (with boba pearls) every day from 2 - 3 pm. Well... I decided to try it, and... it's quite good! Much better than Teaspoon actually. And better than I can make it, too.

This poses a dilemma for me, though. Should I drink milk tea every day? Is that healthy? Would it ruin my appreciation of milk tea to have it so often?

Would would you do?

## Christmas shopping complete!

Today I took a trip to my work's merchandise store to get a gift for my dad. I ended up with this wool hat.

![Wool hat 1](/images/blog_december/wool_hat1.jpg)

(Kibi covering the company logo. The company I work for shall not be revealed on this blog!)

You can fold down the ear flaps of the hat:

![Wool hat 2](/images/blog_december/wool_hat2.jpg)

I figured this would be a good hat for my dad because he doesn't have hair.

Anyway, this marks the end of my Christmas shopping for the year! Woohoo!

# 17 December
## New building day!

We moved to our new building at work today. For a "welcome breakfast" special they had... milk tea from Teaspoon and donuts??

![Teaspoon](/images/blog_december/teaspoon.jpg)

Well, that's already filled my sugar quota for the day!

Aside from that, the building is pretty nice. Compared with my old building, the hallways are wider, have more light, and don't twist and turn in weird ways. As a result, the whole building feels a lot more relaxed and less claustrophobic. I also like the decor in the building more. Our building theme is "hidden structures in nature", and my floor's theme is "flora and fauna". Here is some assorted decor:

![Flora and fauna 1](/images/blog_december/flora_and_fauna1.jpg)
![Flora and fauna 2](/images/blog_december/flora_and_fauna2.jpg)
![Flora and fauna 3](/images/blog_december/flora_and_fauna3.jpg)

In case you can't see it, at the bottom of this owl-girl one it is lightly written: "Hunting the surface". I wonder what it means?

![Flora and fauna 4](/images/blog_december/flora_and_fauna4.jpg)

This is a wall covered in real tree bark.

## The beauty of rain

Is rain more beautiful during the day, or during the night? Is it more beautiful in the city, or out in nature? In my opinion, it's beautiful in all those cases!

Rain at night in the city is beautiful because of the way light reflects off the ground. Please enjoy these photographs I took! Though they don't turn out nearly as well as seeing them in person.

## Ito En stuffing out the competition?

Today I happened to be at Mitsuwa, so naturally I went to look for canned milk tea. To my surprise, they didn't have the usual Royal Milk Tea from Sangaria! Instead, it was replaced by this one from Ito En:

![Ito En milk tea](/images/blog_december/ito_en_milk_tea.jpg)

Curiously, this one claims that it is "Hawaii Exclusive" (apparently not though?).

I wonder why they changed it. I noticed that all the other bottled tea they had was also Ito En brand. And, come to think of it, Ito En has a pretty big presenence at Mitsuwa, with Matcha Love and their little store next to it. It makes me wonder if Ito En has a lot of influence with Mitsuwa, and is able to convince them to carry only their tea for some reason. I can only imagine what the company politics of tea brands is like!

By the way, if you're wondering how good this tea was: it was pretty good when warmed up!

## Holiday gift donation

This year for holiday gift my work gave us $400 to donate to some charities or organizations of our choice (among several pre-approved options... I guess you can't "donate" it to yourself!).

It's hard to know what to pick. Luckily, they do their best to make it easy for you. They have a slick website up, with a bunch of organizations listed with pictures and descriptions.

How would you decide where to donate the money? Would you pick something close to home, or something far away? Would you help people, or animals, or the world?

I ended up donating to the Wikimedia Foundation as well as to the World Wildlife Fund.

## Gift shopping

Today I went downtown to get some gifts. The big tree by city hall was lit up today!

![City hall tree](/images/blog_december/city_hall_tree.jpg)

Note the best photo... you had to be there!

I ended up buying a necklace for my mom at the art pop-up. Unfortunately, I don't have a photo, because they wrapped it already.

I wanted to get something for your mom, too! I got her this plant in a cup.

![Cup plant](/images/blog_december/cup_plant.jpg)

Also, I bought some chocolate to send to our friends in Sacramento. Would you like to add something as well, or should I just send it as is?

![Alexander's chocolate](/images/blog_december/alexanders_chocolate.jpg)

For my sister, I ordered something online. I bought _Undertale_ for Switch for her. Hopefully she hasn't already played it.

I still don't have anything for my dad though. What to do...?

...Also, I don't have a present for you, yet! This is the trickiest one!

## Team lead is leaving

Today at work I received the news that my team lead is leaving. Specifically, the team lead of phishing, which is my focus area.

I'm not even surprised by people leaving anymore. It just feels like an inevitability.

Still, this is a little concerning for the phishing team, as we no longer have a leader. With the team lead gone, I'm actually the engineer in phishing who has been here the longest. However, I'm still the lowest level of employee, and definitely not capable of being a team lead. I can't see any of the other engineers being in a position to step up, either.

What's going to happen to us? Will we become completely directionless?

## The search for perfect hot chocolate continues

Are you aware that I am on an eternal quest to find good hot chocolate? Of course, Dandelion's is good, but that's not easily available to me.

Today at work they held an event called "Cocoa and community day". They had vendors from the community come to sell holiday gifts. Also my work provided some hot chocolate and desserts. So I had to go check it out, for the hot chocolate.

The hot chocolate wasn't anything special. It was quite thin. Essentially like chocolate milk but warmed up.

They also had these cookies though, which tasted quite nice!

## Cold days, late buses

I'm not sure why, but the buses to and from work have become consistently late recently. Unfortunately, this has coincided with colder temperatures. Maybe the roads are more crowded because people don't want to bike to work when it's cold?

Anyway, the unfortunate result is that recently I have been cold while waiting for the bus. And I'm even wearing my down jacket. What to do? I could bring an extra jacket, but it's more to carry around during the day. Still, I may end up doing just that.

Meanwhile, inside the office is too warm for my down jacket. So I will need a third, lighter jacket to wear while inside??

## Super Smash Bros. Ultimate

The latest game in the Super Smash Bros. series just released! We played together over the past couple of days and it was a lot of fun! Today I played more by myself.

This one is called "Ultimate" because it brings back every character from every past game, and most of the stages, too! Plus some new stuff.

So there are quite a lot of characters in this game. How many do you recognize?

![Smash Ultimate characters](/images/blog_december/smash_ultimate_characters.jpg)

By the way, I discovered that Isabelle dances like I do! 

![Isabelle](https://media1.tenor.com/images/b9c7edfaf961edf8cc765d9d09cb4c93/tenor.gif)

You go, Isabelle!

## Maison Alyzée

Today we tried the new French bakery at downtown!

![Maison Alyzee 1](/images/blog_december/maison_alyzee1.jpg)
![Maison Alyzee 2](/images/blog_december/maison_alyzee2.jpg)

We had a bit of a wait to get our dish, but in the end, I really liked it!

The chocolate tart you got was, as you said, a little too similar to eating a chocolate bar. Not bad, but maybe it could have used something light and fluffy, or something cakey, in order to differentiate it?

The _signature delice pecan_ I got, though, was fantastic. I loved how soft the filling was. But the flavors were the standout. And I'm not talking about the pecan and maple flavors, although those were good. I'm talking about the incredible vanilla flavor. Vanilla has a reputation for being boring, but here (and in macarons I have tried) it is really quite fantastic. Perhaps vanilla is a mostly forgotten art?

## White elephant gift exchange

Today at work we had our white elephant gift exchange. I received a double-walled thermos. Not the most exciting gift, but I never had a chance to trade it for anything else. Maybe it's karma for me talking up double-walled cups so much!

That said, I'm not sure if there was a gift I would have preferred instead. At the exchange, the other gifts included a huge nerf gun, a dinosaur-shaped cookie jar, M&Ms with stuff related to our work printed on them, a couple of board games, a stuffed toy, and a figurine. What would you have picked?

Come to think of it, the gift I brought was a little boring too. Next year, I'll try my best to think of something crazy to bring...!

## So what is eggnog anyway?

So they have eggnog in the kitchens at work now. I don't remember ever trying eggnog before, so I decided I had to give it a go!

It tasted like... thickened milk, mixed with candy canes (?) or maybe cough syrup (?). But also somehow pretty good??

Anyway, having no idea what eggnog actually is, I decided to look it up. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggnog), it's basically just sweetened milk mixed with raw egg and some kind of alcohol, and maybe some flavorings. I guess the version I tried didn't have alcohol, though. Fun fact: according to Wikipedia, eggnog used to be known as "milk punch"!

## Postcard from the heart #2: Cozy cafe

It's our third year relationship anniversary! So I made you this card.

![Postcard #2](/images/blog_december/postcard2.jpg)

What could be written on the back?

The coloring of this card is meant to look like Kibi is sitting inside a cafe. There are two large windows looking out into a sunset. The bright colors of the outside are meant to contrast with the cool, muted colors of the interior. Can you see it?

By the way, in order to celebrate our relationship anniversary, I wanted to go a certain place with you! It will only take an hour or two, so please go with me this weekend (or another weekend soon)?

# 4 December
## Adventures in the labyrinth continue

It's been a while since we last heard from Alice and co. I tend to post story entries when not much else interesting happened that day. But these last few weeks have had a lot of events. I guess that's the nature of the holiday season!

Anyway, last time, Alice and friends spent the night camping in the forest after a day of exploring. The latest chapter is [here](/story#２４章), English version [here](/english_story#chapter-24).

## Intern calls

I had to call a few intern candidates to see if they are a good fit for my project. The intern candidates may be nervous about doing these calls, but actually, I am probably more nervous than them!

A couple of the calls were difficult, and I wasn't sure what to say some of the time or how to get the intern candidate interested in the project. However, there was one candidate that seemed to instantly understand what was interesting about the project. That candidate seemed really excited about it, so I hope it works out with that one.

## Tofugu podcast

I learned that Tofugu, the company that makes WaniKani, has a podcast (and a blog). They are in English, and they cover Japanese language or culture topics.

I decided to check it out today, and listened to two podcast episodes. One was about transitive / intransitive verbs. The other was about name enders, like -san, -chan, etc.

In the first episode, I learned that Japanese usually has different words for the transitive and intransitive versions of an action (for example, 入れる and 入る). English, similarly, sometimes has different words for the transitive and intransitive versions of action (for example, "to insert" and "to enter"). However, English oftentimes does not have a separate word for intranstive actions, and instead just uses passive voice (for example, "to open" and "to be opened"). Curious!

In the second episode, they talked about different scenarios when you would use different name enders. It's useful to hear this additional context that you wouldn't learn from just studying vocab.

## Holiday party 2018

We went to my company holiday party today!

![Holidy party 1](/images/blog_december/holiday_party1.jpg)

The venue looked pretty nice! Although I should say it was a little small for the number of people there were.

They had a large Christmas tree there that was really pretty!

![Christmas tree](/images/blog_december/holiday_party2.jpg)
チカチカチカ・・・


I was a little surprised to see it there actually, since I don't remember the past parties having any references to Christmas.

The activities at the party weren't so interesting this time, so we spent most of the time eating food!

One of the more interesting things they had there was coconut water:

![Coconut water](/images/blog_december/coconut_drink.jpg)

You didn't seem to like it. I don't think I did either? It's complicated; I'm not sure how I feel about it. Maybe it would be good with sugar...?

We were worried about a lack of desserts at the party, but the pecan pies came in at the end!
