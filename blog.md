## You told me to eat more fruit

So I looked more closely at the fruit available at my work. I found this:

![Medjool date](/images/blog_july2/medjool_date.jpg)

It's a medjool date! Have you ever had it before? I tried it, and it was... extremely good! I was super shocked, because it has a bit of a weird appearance! It was basically like candy, both with its sweetness and its consistency. I could eat this fruit all day!

With a taste like that, though... Is it healthy? I went did some searching online, but I couldn't tell which sources were reputable. Anyway, from what I could gather, it does have a very high amount of sugar in it, but apparently it's not as bad for you because of the fiber in the date, so it gets absorded into your body more gradually. And it has other nutrients on top of that. Still, it's probably not a good idea to eat a ton of them, unfortunately...
