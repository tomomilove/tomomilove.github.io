## Another library

I was happy about our recent trip to Palo Alto for the concert, so I decided to go back to there today. I didn't have much to do so I looked for a place to sit and read my book, and I found a library right downtown. I had no idea it was there!

![Palo Alto library 1](/images/blog_july2/palo_alto_library1.jpg)

It's super tiny! Not very crowded either, there were a number of seats available to sit. One negative aspect though is they have a toddler section, and toddlers can't be quiet. Not a great fit for a library this small, I think.

They also have a pretty cute courtyard area! It seems like it would be very pleasant to sit outside!

I have to say though, I'm getting kind of bored on the weekends, just going to libraries and sitting around. I thought about it and I really want to do some kind of social activity. I think I will look up some options.

## Le Ton beau de Marot

I decided to give this book as a present for my intern when he leaves (in less than a month!). He likes reading, and he's interested in language understanding like me.

![Le Ton beau](/images/blog_july2/le_ton_beau.jpg)

Have I told you about this book before? It's all about translation. It was quite an influence on me and my thought process.

If I had to sum up the book's main point, it would be: Language cannot be truly translated by a computer, because the process of translation is as much of a creative art as the original writing, and in fact, can even be more difficult in certain ways.

The most interesting part of the book for me is when the author discusses tradeoffs around doing what he calls "transculturation". Meaning, if there are cultural references in a book, should you translate them literally, or should you change them into analogous cultural references? An example of this would be if you were translating a Japanese book where characters were eating ramen, and instead have them eat hamburgers in the English version. Ther are pretty interesting arguments around when you should or shouldn't do transculturation, and to what extent.

## Onomatopoeia

Onomatopoeia is definitely a large gap in my Japanese knowledge. They're not taught in WaniKani because they aren't made up of kanji. 

I read Tofugu's article on onomatopoeia but it didn't really help me learn them. Although I did learn a couple of interesting rules around them. Did you know:

- Ones that start with voiced consonants tend to represent stronger, louder sounds
- The vowel can indicate how high or low pitched the sound is meant to be: a for medium, i for high, and o for low.
- Repeated parts tend to indicate something happening over and over, or continuously
- Ending with っ (glottal stop) can indicate abruptness, while ending with り can indicate softness or gentleness.
- A long vowel can indicate longness of the action

I guess these rules make sense! The article says some of these apply cross-language.

By the way, I think my favorite onomatopoeia so far is ペラペラ, meaning speaking a foreign languge fluently. Seems pretty tough to get there!

Also, Tofugu linked to a site called [Onomatopedia](https://onomatopedia.jp/) which has a bunch of them listed and categorized, with little comics and pictures! It's fun to check out if you are bored!

## Music of Tchaikovsky

Today we and your mother went to a concert by the San Francisco Symphony at Stanford's Frost Amphitheater!

It was a really nice experience! I was simultaneously struck by the beauty of the cool summer evening weather, the amphitheatre itself, and the music as well!

Here's some pictures of the theater! I love how it was nestled among the trees, and such beautiful trees they were!

![Frost theater 3](/images/blog_july2/frost_theater3.jpg)

I don't know much about music, but I still really enjoy it. It sounds so fantastical to me, so I like to think up fantasy stories while I'm listening to it. I can think up sad parts, or happy parts, or epic parts, depending on what is happening in the music!

## My Family and Other Animals

It's been a while since I read a novel, but I decided to start on this one my mother gave me a long time back called _My Family and Other Animals_. Recently most of my free time was taken up learning Japanese or gaming, but I finished all the games I want to play, so now I have some time for reading a book.

Anyway, the book is decent so far! It's about an English family that one day decides to move to the Greek island of Corfu. The title of the book makes sense: So far, it spends a lot of time describing all the family members and their quirks, and a lot of time describing animals on the island. The book has a very matter-of-fact kind of humor, and the world it describes seems so lush and friendly. It really makes me want to visit the area!

## All about 込む

I listened to an hour-long Tofugu podcast all about the word 込む and what it does when it's attached to other verbs. You may not realize it, but it's an infamously confusing topic for for native English speakers! I even saw a scene in ダーリンは外国人 about this!

Anyway, to summrize the podcast, when attached to others verbs, there are about 4 different categories of meanings it can add:

- __Going into something__. For example, 飛び込む could mean to jump into.
- __Going even deeper into something__. For example, 入り込む could mean entering deeply, maybe to a point that you're not supposed to go.
- __Doing something a lot, or intensely__. For example, 話し込む could mean talking for a long time, or intesely talking.
- __Repeatedly doing something, up until a certain point__. I forget the exact verb, but they gave an example of repeatedly practicing playing a song until you master it.

Does that sound right to you? Does it match your intuition?

Hopefully I'll understand this pretty well, now!

## Library sample

I went to the library today, as usual!  I spend a lot of time sitting in the library, but I never really look at the books. So today I decided to just wander the rows and look at the books!

![Fashions in hair](/images/blog_july2/fashions_in_hair.jpg)
Would you like to read a >500 page book written in 1969 about fashions in hair throughout the ages?

![Shells book](/images/blog_july2/shells_book.jpg)
Or how about one showing over 600 kinds of shells?

![Car manuals](/images/blog_july2/car_manuals.jpg)
There are multiple shelves filled with nothing but car manuals. Each volume is for a single model of car in a single year.

![Say no book](/images/blog_july2/say_no_book.jpg)
This book is all about advising women on how to say no to things. It reminds me I need to take it better when you say no to me!

![Music book](/images/blog_july2/music_book.jpg)
In this book, the author admits to being a music pirate and then spends hundreds of pages justifying it. ...Just kidding, I'm not that sarcastic! I don't actually judge the author. I think it's a really interesting topic how people's perception of the value of music has changed!

![Stained glass book](/images/blog_july2/stained_glass_book.jpg)
This is a terrible photo! But anyway, this is an oversized book about stained glass. I think oversized books are fun!

It's hard to put into words how much variety of books there is on display. I hardly knew which ones to photograph, but I hope I gave a good sample!

## Mountain View's best milk tea award

A few years of living here, I've finally decided what is the best milk tea you can get around here! It is... drumroll please...

Mantra India's chai!
![Mantra India chai](/images/blog_july2/mantra_india_chai.jpg)

It's really good! It's very mild. Not nearly as spiced as other Indian chai I've had. It's also not very sweet. I think you are meant to put sugar in it, but I never do. I normally don't like unsweetened milk tea, but this one is great for some reason. I like its mildness -- it feels comfortable and homely in a way, like something you can drink a lot of and be happy, the way tea should be.

It comes free with the lunch buffet, but I wonder if I could just walk in and order it by itself? I would totally do that, if I could...

## Reading ダーリンは外国人

I was reading more into this book! I think it's a pretty good level for me -- not too easy, not too hard.

The characters remind me of you and me a lot! There was this scene where Tony gets really depressed, because when someone asks Saori if he is a good husband, and she responds with 「んーうん」(meaning yes, I guess), but he mishears it as 「ううん」(meaning no). Then he wants to be a better husband, so he decides to do some of the chores, so he volunteers to wash dishes. However, he doesn't do a very good job, like leaving the dishes for too long, or missing certain spots on the dishes like the underside of the bowls. So then Saori has to teach him about that. This scene reminds me of stuff that has happened between us!

Also, here's a funny picture from the book!

## Gyu-kaku

Today we went to Gyu-kaku! I had been wanting to go for a while!

![Gyu-kaku](/images/blog_july2/gyu_kaku.jpg)

It was pretty nice! It was kind of similar to a Korean BBQ place, but I liked how it wasn't all-you-can-eat, so I didn't feel pressured to eat too much! I also thought ordering the rice dish turned out to be a good idea, because it gave us something to eat inbetween the meats being cooked.

Overall it was really tasty! I want to go back someday!

## Trying some old games

I signed up for Nintendo's online service, and as a part of it, they give you a collection of old NES games to play for free. If you don't know NES, it was Nintendo's first console! Anyway, I decided to try a few I hadn't played before!

_Kirby's Adventure_
![Kirby's Adventure 1](/images/blog_july2/kirbys_adventure1.jpg)
First I tried out _Kirby's Adventure_. This game is really unique for an NES game! A lot of games of this era were very difficult, but Kirby bucks the trend by being quite easy. It's also one of the nicest looking games of the time!

![Kirby's Adventure 2](/images/blog_july2/kirbys_adventure2.jpg)
There was this cute claw machine minigame!

_Ninja Gaiden_
![Ninja Gaiden 1](/images/blog_july2/ninja_gaiden1.jpg)
_Ninja Gaiden_, on the other hand, is known for being very difficult. I tried it and it wasn't so bad though. I was surprised that this game actually takes place in the modern world -- you travel through areas like back alleys of an American city, you fight soldiers with rocket launchers, and things like that... the whole thing feels extremely 80s action film, which I find really funny!

![Ninja Gaiden 2](/images/blog_july2/ninja_gaiden2.jpg)
I was surprised it has pretty stylish cut scenes and an involved story, as well!

_Punch-Out!!_
![Punch-Out!!](/images/blog_july2/punch_out.jpg)
In _Punch-Out!!_ you play as the boxer Little Mac, and fight boxing matching against imposing, cartoonish opponents. Do you remember Little Mac from Super Smash Bros? I used him when we played together that one time!

This game is all about recognizing what moves your opponent is going to do, so you can dodge in the correct way, and choose the right counter-attack. It's actually pretty fun and unique!

## More fuubutsushi

I read about halfway through 日本風物詩! Here are three interesting things I learned from it. I wonder if you already know most of the things in this book, though...?

![Daruma](/images/blog_july2/daruma.jpg)

Daruma are apparently meant to be the Indian Buddhist priest Boddhidharma. The reason they have no legs is that, purportedly, he meditated so long that he could no longer use his legs. And their eyes are wide because he cut off his eyelids in order to prevent himself from falling asleep. Some daruma are weighted in the bottom, so if you tip them, they will right themselves -- this symbolizes how he never gave up!

![Mizuhiki](/images/blog_july2/mizuhiki.jpg)

The cords used for wrapping gifts in this style are known as mizuhiki (水引). I liked this one because the book says gifts are wrapped carefully due to the custom that gifts are not supposed to be opened in front of the gift giver. I like that custom! Everyone should adopt it!

![Uta-garuta](/images/blog_july2/uta_garuta.jpg)

It says there is a card game based on 百人一首, that book of poems your mother gave me! The game is called 歌がるた. The way it works is there are a bunch of cards laid out on the ground containing the second half of each of the poems. Someone reads one of the poems allowed, and then people have to grab the correct card. It sounds kind of fun!

## You told me to eat more fruit

So I looked more closely at the fruit available at my work. I found this:

![Medjool date](/images/blog_july2/medjool_date.jpg)

It's a medjool date! Have you ever had it before? I tried it, and it was... extremely good! I was super shocked, because it has a bit of a weird appearance! It was basically like candy, both with its sweetness and its consistency. I could eat this fruit all day!

With a taste like that, though... Is it healthy? I went did some searching online, but I couldn't tell which sources were reputable. Anyway, from what I could gather, it does have a very high amount of sugar in it, but apparently it's not as bad for you because of the fiber in the date, so it gets absorded into your body more gradually. And it has other nutrients on top of that. Still, it's probably not a good idea to eat a ton of them, unfortunately...
