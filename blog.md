## Normal tea vs milk tea round 2
Earlier I mentioned I've just been having regular tea instead of milk tea... Then I found this!

We had it with tiramisu!

Too much caffeine for you?

I like this canned milk tea quite a lot actually, more than pretty much any milk tea shop around, except for Asha. It's a lot cheaper than milk tea shops, too.

I wish this canned milk tea was available within walking distance of where I live! Or maybe I don't? If it were so readily available, maybe I would become too unhealthy...

## Hike + free ice cream day!
It was a fun day together! We went hiking near Stevens Creek Resevoir:

We saw a really big tree that I liked! How old do you think it was? How long do you think it will live?

Here on some landscape shots!

After the hike, we went to Mitsuwa to eat ramen and claim the free ice cream we worked so hard to earn:

Ahhhh... free ice cream is twice as sweet!

While we were there, we saw a huge line for MoDo... mochi donuts. Is it just mochi connected in a circle to look like a donut? Or does it taste like a donut, too? If we get a chance in the future, we should try one!

## Every day is special
Woohoo happy birthday!

Do you feel very different on your birthday? People will say you are now a year older, but in reality, you are only one day older. So maybe it’s not that big of a deal?

Actually though, I think birthdays are important, because they mark the completion of a year. Although you may not change very much on your birthday itself, you do change over the course of a year. So I think when we celebrate birthdays, really what we are celebrating is the experience of one year. That’s why I thought a year-long blog would be a cool birthday gift. My plan is to have an update mostly every day for one year (if I miss a day here or there, I'll make it up with multiple posts on a later day!). It is a gift that gives over the course of the entire year.

I’ll try to update the blog with things I did, saw, or thought about that day. I can’t promise it will always be interesting, but I'll do my best to keep it fun. After all, isn't every day special? I think there should be something worth remembering about every day!

To start off with, I’ve already added 10 blog posts (including this one). Please enjoy them!

## Mise en place
There's a food truck that comes to my work called _Mise en place_. I always wondered what it meant, and today I happened to learn it's a phrase meaning "everything in place". Apparently, it's a phrase that chefs use to refer to setting up all the ingredients before starting cooking.

I decided to make my own "Mise en place" today:

What do you think it will become...?

## Interesting things at work #2: A forest!
I found this wall at work that’s supposed to look like a forest:

![Office forest](/images/blog_july/office_forest.jpg)

It’s cool, I guess? There’s a little pathway here: 

![Forest pathway](/images/blog_july/forest_pathway.jpg)

I really want to walk on this pathway! But I don't think you're supposed to. Maybe they should have just made the whole room a forest?

## Normal tea vs milk tea
I bought Asha’s house black tea in order to recreate their milk tea, but recently I’ve found myself using it just to make regular tea.

Do you remember my many attempts to create Asha's milk tea? I've gotten pretty close, but I haven't truly matched it, and I can't figure out what's off. I think the key must be in the sweetened condensed milk. I need it to provide thickness and richness, but if I add too much of it, then it creates an odd flavor. I'm not sure what Asha does to make theirs so perfect. Maybe they just add more sugar? 

Anyway, since I can’t quite get the milk tea right, I’ve given up on it for the time being. But that's only because I've found something better: the regular tea! I've just been making the house black tea following the normal instructions: 2 teaspoons of tea, 212 degree water, 2 minutes. Then I add a bit of sugar, and it’s perfect. It might actually be my favorite tea I’ve ever had!

![Black tea](/images/blog_july/black_tea.jpg)
Ah... Perfect!

Next time you come over in the afternoon, you should try it!

## Shirt shopping
I just bought three shirts online! Hopefully they fit well, so I won’t have to return them!

I find buying clothes to be very difficult. One reason is that I have trouble finding clothes that fit. I am short, so XS size is best for me lengthwise. But unfortunately, those are too tight for me in the shoulders. So usually I get size S, but these are too long for me. As a result, I feel that most of the shirts I have are a little too long for me!

Another reason I find buying clothes to be difficult is that I’ve accumulated a series of rules about what not to get. Here are some of them: 

1. No logos on the clothes. I want to avoid making any statements that would lead people to make judgments on my personality.
2. No collars that button down, as they are too fancy.
3. No plain t-shirts, as they are too simple.
4. No linen (linen is a fabric made from flax, which is different than cotton. Most clothes are made from cotton). The reason I avoid linen is that one time I owned a linen shirt and I found it to be scratchy.
5. Avoid short sleeves. My arms are too skinny, so they don't fit short sleeves very well.
6. Nothing black or white, as these colors are too extreme. Greys are okay.

Come to think of it, this is a very negative approach to clothes shopping. Maybe I should make rules for things I like, instead...?

## A postcard from the heart #1: The colors of summer
What’s this?

![The colors of summer](/images/blog_july/postcard.jpg)

Today I colored in this postcard! Do you remember that Tammy and Rachel gave me a series of postcards to color?

The theme for this postcard is “The colors of summer”. I chose colors to represent the sky and the sun, as well as earth and plants. The art is very abstract, so I thought I should choose colors based on the real world to counterbalance that.

When I was coloring this post card, I tried to make it so that no adjacent areas had the same color. However, I made a few mistakes. Can you spot them? (If you’re going to look, maybe wait until you have the actual postcard in hand, as it’d be easier than looking at this photo).

Coloring this postcard was an interesting experience. At first glance I thought the design looked pretty simple and symmetric, but the more I looked at it, the more I saw the irregularities. As I was coloring it in, I realized there are a lot of weird, one-off details, and it’s barely symmetric at all. I wonder what the artist was thinking when he drew it. He must have had fun breaking his own patterns.

By the way, this is a postcard, isn’t it? Could there be something written on the back...?

## Octopath Traveler
Recently I’ve been playing this game called Octopath Traveler. The main concept of the game is that there are eight main characters that each have their own story, but they meet up and travel together.

![Octopath Traveler forest](/images/blog_july/octopath_forest.jpg)

The game has a pretty distinctive visual style. It mixes together pixel art that is meant to be reminiscent of old RPGs from the early 90s, along with modern 3D environments and lighting effects.

One thing I really like about the game is the music. Here’s a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2gICtRg2UQ) showcasing the game’s orchestra recording one of the songs!

## Interesting things at work #1: Flowers
This flower-covered walkway at work is really pretty. It makes me happy to see it fairly well filled out. I’m looking forward to it growing more!

![Flowers 1](/images/blog_july/flowers1.jpg)

Did you know that Soda Hall (the computer science building at Berkeley) was supposed to have a vine-covered walkway in front of it? However, the vines never managed to grow big enough to fill it out, which always disappointed me every day. Soda Hall was also supposed to have plants growing on the roof, but they never put them there. If I ever became an adminstrator at Berkeley, getting those plants there would be my first priority!

## Chipped tooth?
Something strange happened in my mouth the other day! There was some kind of sharp edge on my front tooth, and whenever my tongue brushed against it, it got hurt. It was right at the neutral resting position of my tongue, so my tongue was getting hurt constantly!

At first I thought it might have been something that got stuck between the teeth, but I could never find anything. So I think it might have been a chip. However, it largely disappeared after a day. What happened to it? Did the tooth heal (do teeth do that?), or maybe the edge just got sanded down? 

I’m glad it’s gone now, but one thing worries me: Where did the chip come from? Will it happen again? I didn’t notice when it happened, so perhaps I just bit my teeth during the night? That’s unfortunate because it’s not something I can control. Is there anything I can do to help prevent it...?

## New domain name, colors, and fonts
I’ve given this website a bit of an update!

Perhaps most apparent is some color changes. The background is a darker, softer blue that should be easier on the eyes. I also made the font white, and got rid of the yellow headings. I spent a long time playing with the colors to find a nice combination. My goal was to overall give the site a more sophisticated look. Do you like it? If it had been up to you, which colors would you have chosen?

I also spent some time picking a font for Japanese, since I plan to write some of the future blog posts in Japanese! I chose a font with rounded lines because I thought it looked more fun. However, I might change it after I write more text and get a better sense of what it looks like. I read some articles on Japanese typography, such as [this one](http://aqworks.com/en/blog/2016/09/20/perfect-japanese-typography/) and [this one](https://medium.com/@PavelLaptev/japanese-typography-on-the-web-tips-and-tricks-981f120ad20e), in order to understand how to properly add Japanese to this website.

Did you notice the site has a new domain name, too? It’s just [tomomilove.com](http://tomomilove.com) now. The domain is registered under your name. Congratulations, you are now a domain owner!

I also made a few miscellaneous formatting fixes to this website. I decided to center pictures, increase their size, and give them a little border, and I also fixed some issues with the site header not displaying properly on mobile devices.
