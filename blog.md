## Mega Man 11

One of the first games I ever played was Mega Man 2.

This is a genre of game known as platformer. Essentially, your goal is to run, jump, and shoot your way to the end of the level.

I first played Mega Man 2 around 20 years ago, and even at the time, the game was old. The game was originally released in 1988.

Anyway, the series is still going, and today they released Mega Man 11, which I decided to buy.

The graphics have improved a little bit, but otherwise, it's very much the same type of game it was 30 years ago. I guess that's a part of the charm, though.

## One-Pan Coconut Chicken Curry _with Sweet Potatoes and Bok Choy_
Here's a new Blue Apron recipe I made.

It was supposed to be curry... but all the liquid of the curry disappeared. I think it was a combination of me accidentally boiling it away and the sweet potatoes absorbing the rest.

As for the recipe, it was all right. Sweet potatoes are always good, and they go decently with the curry flavor. As for the bok choy, it felt like it was barely there. It shrunk a lot during cooking and I didn't really notice it while eating. At least it's healthy, though?

The chicken I overcooked slightly, but it wasn't bad!
