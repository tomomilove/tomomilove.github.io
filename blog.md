## _Poems of Friendship_
I finally got around to reading this book. I can't quite remember when or why I received it. Did Tammy and Rachel give it to me? Was it for my birthday, or for some other reason?

There were some nice poems in here. I already ready you my two favorites. One of them, _Friendship_ by Dinah Maria Mulock Craik, says that a friend should do the following for all the things their friend says:

"Take and sift them--
Keep what is worth keeping--
And with the breath of kindness
Blow the rest away."

Kind of harsh, but not necessarily bad advice!

Another, _My Familiar_ by John Godfrey Saxe, complains of a friend who stays too long. It contains some witty couplets like:

    He takes the strangest liberties,--
        But never takes his leave!"

and

"He opens everything he sees--
    Except the entry door!"
    
Here's another one I liked that I want to take to heart. It's _Friendship_ by Ella Wheeler Wilcox:

"Dear friend, I pray thee, if thou wouldst be proving
    Thy strong regard for me,
Make me no vows. Lip service is not loving;
    Let they faith speak for thee.

Swear not to me that nothing can divide us--
    So little such oaths mean.
But when distrust and envy creep bseide us,
    Let them not come between.

Say not to me the depths of thy devotion
    Are deepter than the sea;
But watch, lest doubt or some unkind emotion
    Embitter them for thee.

Vow not to love me ever and forever,
    Words are such idle things;
But when we differ in opinions, never
    Hurt me by little stings.

I'm sick of words: they are so lightly spoken,
    And spoken, are but air.
I'd rather feel they trust in me unbroken
    Than list thy words so fair.

If all the little proofs of trust are heeded,
    If thou art always kind,
No sacrifice, no promise will be needed
    To satisfy my mind."

I haven't read poetry in a long time -- probably never since school? I found it nice. Sometimes poetry gets a bad rap for being boring or obtuse, but I think a good poem can delight with it's structure and word choice. For example, the poem about the friend who never goes away is a lot of fun because of its repetitive and rhythmic structure.
