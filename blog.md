## Gin gins

They had this new candy at work I decided to try!

Part of the reason I decided to try it is that the name was cute!

Anyway, it was really gingery, as you might expect! And really chewy as well. My first thought when I put it in my mouth was "Is this even food??", because it was so chewy. Overall it was pretty good, but I probably won't eat it again! Candy isn't the best use of sugar, so I have a pretty high bar for any candy I would eat.

## Valley of the Sun

We took a chill day downtown today! But I was so wrapped up in it I forgot to take photos!

We started it off with ramen at Shalala. I got the shoyu tonkotsu and it was really intense! It was extremely garlicky, and that's even considering you took a bunch from me. And a very high amount of bean sprouts. It was pretty good but a bit too much for me! Maybe a half-sized order with a side would have been better...?

After that we discovered that the gelato place downtown had reopened! I'm not sure what the exact situation is, but it looks refreshed and ready to be carried over by the next generation. I thought it was inspiring!

Finally, we worked on a puzzle at the library! The title of the puzzle was "Valley of the Sun", and I wasn't sure where it was supposed to be exactly. But looking up that term on Google, it seems to be Phoenix, Arizona. We made a ton of progress on the puzzle but didn't quite finish. It got me thinking though: Are there people out there who do puzzles quickly as a competition, I wonder? I've never heard of such a thing, but I bet there are some people who would get really into it...

## Suddenly San Francisco

Today you called me out suddenly to meet you in San Francisco!

Riding the train and BART there, I thought about how it had been so long since I had last done so. It's pretty easy to get there, but such a hassle to get back, which is why I was thankful you offered to drive me back!

Once there we had hot chocolate of course!

On my quest to find good hot chocolate, this is probably the best. I like the bigger and lighter one, but the small and dense one is good too!

While we were in San Francisco, we did some walking as well. I thought this building was cool!

I like the colors, as well as the round portion on the corner, almost like a tower. I wish I had a round room with windows all around!
