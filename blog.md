## Peer bonus

One of my coworkers gave me a peer bonus today! This is an award you can give someone if they go out of their way to help you. This one was given to me by one of the new members on our team I helped to ramp up.

A peer bonus is a pretty nice thing because the company actually attaches a monetary award to it. I don't remember the exact amount, but I think it's something pretty hefty, like $1000 or so.

I feel like I want to buy something nice for myself with this award!! But I thought about it, and I'm not even sure what I would get. I think the things I really want can't be bought with money. For example:

- I want to get good at Japanese! But this takes time, not money...
- I want to eat a lot of good sweets! But even with a lot of money you can't do that too much because it's unhealthy...
- I want to go traveling! But I'd want to go with you...

So I don't know. If you had $1000 randomly dropped on you, what would you get?

## Sister site

Out of curiosity I decided to search "tomomilove" on Google to see what would come up. Surprisingly, I found someone else's personal blog [tomomilove.jimdo.com](https://tomomilove.jimdo.com/). I guess you could consider it a sister site of sorts!

There's not too much on the site, but it has some photos of the person, who says they are an English-Japanese interpreter. It also links to some other blogs (seemingly run by the same person?) that have a little more written in them, mostly poetry it seems. 

The site has a mix of English and Japanese, and the English is not very good. It's funny -- I guess my blog must look the same way: it has a mix of Japanese and English, but the Japanese isn't very good. The two sites are very much counterparts in that sense.

## Credit nightmare

So there's an item on my todo list since November that I finally decided to tackle today...

But first, some background: A long time ago a bunch of credit info was leaked and it was recommended for people to freeze their credit reports. After a long and terrible struggle, I managed to do it. Credit reports are managed by 3 different companies, so you have to do it with each of the 3.

Lately, however, things changed. Apparently this stuff is now managed by an account system, so you need to create an online account with each of the 3 companies.

So after putting it off for so long, I went to create my accounts... and I succeeded with the first two, but screwed up the last one. They ask some questions to verify your identity, and I didn't read it carefully enough and messed it up. Now in order to fix it I have to call them... Ahhh I hate this. This is why I put it off for so long. Because I knew no matter what it was going to end up a struggle, somehow.

## Allergy medicine

After suffering last night and today morning of sneezing, I decided to go try some allergy medicine.

Results were mixed. At first, it pretty quickly stopped my sneezing, though there was still some nose running. Then, I started feeling kind of weak. It said it was non-drowsy, but maybe not... Anyway, I felt bad for the rest of the day, but my nose did stop running completely. Actually, it felt unnaturally dry. But I guess it's better than constant sneezing.

I'll consider this a mixed success! I'll take the medicine again if it gets bad, but sparingly.

## Summer feeling

The past two days have been the first seriously hot days this year, where the sun actually feels painful on your skin. Kind of uncomfortable, but I'm happy that it's warm at night, at least!

Also the past two days, I've had to go to trainings to prepare for my intern's arrival. Yesterday I had a 3 hour long session about intern preparation, and today I had a 2 hour long session. I have to say, it was so long it wasn't a good experience! And I didn't find the information very helpful. It was a lot of stuff I felt like I already knew, like it's important to make your intern feel included on the team, and things like that.

So the past two days have been a little painful. But, both hot weather and interns make me thing of summer, and that makes me happy! Even though I don't get a summer vacation, I still have fond memories of the season. Something about it makes it feel like a chill time, no matter what!

## The backgrounds of Final Fantasy 9

Today I finished that game I was playing, _Final Fantasy 9_. I have to say I really enjoyed it. The story in particular was so sweet and touching.

I wanted to share with you more of the game's backgrounds, because so many were so beautiful and interesting. It's like every screen is a painting, I can't even imagine how long it took them to draw it all. I was taking screenshots constantly while playing the game, so I'd be able to share them with you!

I hope you don't mind 23 screenshots!

## New work laptop

At my work you're allowed to get a new work laptop every few years. I was overdue on mine, so I decided to finally get one.

![Laptop](/images/blog_april/laptop.jpg)

It's a 13" Macbook Pro.

There are a couple of differences compared to my old one:

- Slightly bigger screen, but less bezel so it's overall smaller.
- Heavier.
- More powerful (so it's faster).
- Has a "touch" bar. There's a row of keys at the top that aren't real keys. They're just virtual keys, and they can change depending on what you're doing on your computer. Also there is a fingerprint scanner.
- The real keys make a distinct clacking sound. It feels nice actually, but I'd be worried about annoying other people nearby.
- "Retina" screen. This is a screen with such high resolution that the human eye cannot discern pixels.

The last point is the most important difference, in my opinion. It looks a lot nicer! Now my work laptop outclasses my home laptop... Making me think it might be time to get a new home laptop. But there's nothing really wrong with my home laptop, so I'm not sure it's worth the money to replace.

## Trying my running shoes

I went out and tried my running shoes today!

It's been a long time since I wore shoes with this much cushion and support. Walking felt unreal to me, almost like I was wearing rocket shoes and being propelled forward.

In the end, though, running is still running, and shoes alone won't improve your stamina. I tried running downtown but I couldn't make it all the way there. I was weaker than I thought and had to walk for a large portion. Oh well, at least I have a goal to work towards: to be able to run all the way.

# 20 April
## Zombie Runner

Today I went to a store in Palo Alto my roommate told me about called Zombie Runner. It's both a running shoe store and a coffee shop. You'd think one or both of the sides would be underwhelming, but I heard they're actually both quite good.

The store staff was pretty helpful finding a shoe for me. They watched me run on a treadmill to figure out my running style. Then they brought out three shoes for me to try, and see which one felt the best. This pair clearly felt the best to me, so I got them:

![Running shoes](/images/blog_april/running_shoes.jpg)

Overall it was a very easy process. Since they walked me through it, I didn't have to stand there paralyzed with indecision for a while, and I didn't feel bad about not knowing much about shoes.

After I bought the shoes, they gave me a free drink at the coffee shop. I wanted to get tea, but I had had some earlier that day, so I went for the hot chocolate instead. It was pretty good, but maybe a little too rich!

## 100 Million Books

There's an extension for web browsers you can get called 100 Million Books that shows you a quote from a random book each time you open a new tab or open your web browser.

Today I got an interesting quote I wanted to share with you. It's from the book _The Secret Life of Words_ by Henry Hitchings:

"
[In English] Often we have three terms for the same thing — one Anglo-Saxon, one French, and one clearly absorbed from Latin or Greek. The Anglo-Saxon word is typically a neutral one; the French word connotes sophistication; and the Latin or Greek word, learnt from a written text rather than from human contact, is comparatively abstract and conveys a more scientific notion. Consider, for example, the verbs rise, mount and ascend, or go, depart and exit. In each case, the first word has an Anglo-Saxon source and is informal, the second is French and comparatively formal, while the third is Latin and suggests something more specialized or technical. A more extreme example is fire, flame and conflagration; another, holy, sacred, consecrated. [...]

"Think about the distinction between luck and fortune, fatherly and paternal, hearty and cordial, or almighty and omnipotent. In each case the first, Anglo-Saxon, word is more direct, suggestive of something more primal, more resonant, more tangible. What about the difference between altitude and Anglo-Saxon height [...] We may casually refer to these as synonyms, but we know they are not exactly interchangeable. Many Anglo-Saxon terms have deep emotional charge.
"

So this quote makes the claim that the older, Anglo-Saxon words of English still feel more straightforward and direct to English speakers, even today. I think it's right, at least with the examples mentioned. But I wonder if it really holds true across most of the language?

It kind of made me think of Japanese, as well. Do kun'yomi based words tend to sound more direct to Japanese speakers than on'yomi based words? I wonder.

In any case, I think it's interesting how these effects still persist like 1000 years later. These French words have been a part of English vocabulary for a long time... but will they never truly be accepted?

# 18 April
## Cuphead

I just got this new game called _Cuphead_.

![Cuphead 1](/images/blog_april/cuphead1.jpg)

This is a game where you play as a cup person and fight against a series of bosses. The game tries really hard to look like an old fashioned cartoon, like the original Mickey Mouse. It's a pretty cool look, though also a little unsettling at times.

![Cuphead 4](/images/blog_april/cuphead4.jpg)
![Cuphead 2](/images/blog_april/cuphead2.jpg)
![Cuphead 3](/images/blog_april/cuphead3.jpg)

The game is pretty much only about fighting bosses. It's famous for being really difficult, but that's part of why I find it fun. I have to fight these bosses like a dozen times in order to beat them, but it's satisfying figuring out the right strategies to use and then being able to execute them effectively.

# 17 April
## Georgian soda

I went back to the Georgian food truck at Milk Pail, and decided to try one of their soft drinks.

![Tarragon soda 1](/images/blog_april/tarragon_soda1.jpg)

Can you read the flavor on the bottle? It's tarragon flavor, actually. I'm not sure if you're familar with tarragon, but it's an herb. Like, the kind of thing I've had in a chicken sandwich. Kind of an odd flavor for a soda, and it really did taste quite herby. But actually, I thought it was super good! A unique flavor I liked a lot! I think I'll get it again.

By the way, it also had a bit of a weird cap:

![Tarragon soda 2](/images/blog_april/tarragon_soda2.jpg)

It's neither a twist cap nor a pop bottle cap like you'd find in America. Instead, it's got this tab you pull up on to get the cap off.

It's so interesting seeing the norms of other countries like this! This cap is probably normal over there. And according to Wikipedia, Tarragon soda is pretty popular over there as well.

# 16 April
## 風物詩

Your mom gave me a book called 日本風物詩! I didn't know what the word 風物詩 mean, and you said it was something that reminds you of a certain time. I looked up the definition online, and that was spot on!

So I thought about, what are the 風物詩 in my life? What are things that remind me of different seasons?

#### Spring
- Walking around the neighborhood and looking at flowers!

#### Summer
- Mango smoothies
- My sun hat
- Trips to the ocean
- Crowded buses due to interns!

#### Fall
- Hot chocolate sold at Trader Joe's

#### Winter
- Lights wrapped around trees downtown
- My space heater

That's what I can think of for now! It was kind of difficult, maybe my habits don't vary much by season? What would your 風物詩 be, Tomomi?

## Chapter 37

Last time, Alice and co. defeated the red-haired bear king! Find out what happens next in chapter 37 [here](/story#３７章). English version [here](/english_story#chapter-37).

Sorry, this is a long chapter, but there wasn't a good way to break it up. This chapter marks the end of the first major arc of the story, so please enjoy!

# 14 April
## 百人一首

I read through (in English) the book of poems your mother gave me! I wasn't expecting this, but nearly all of the poems were about lost love, or longing for love. I guess that's what the style of the poem is about? Anyway, a lot of them were super depressing, but I recorded some of my favorites for you (generally on the more positive side):

Just as the Minano River<br>
surges from the peak<br>
of Mount Tsukuba,<br>
so my love cascades<br>
to make deep pools.

筑波嶺の峯より落つるみなの川恋ぞつもりて淵となりける

As the human heart's so fickle<br>
your feelings may have changed,<br>
but at least in my old home<br>
the plum blossoms bloom as always<br>
with a fragrance of the past.

人はいさ心も知らずぶるさとは花ぞ昔の香ににほひける

I thought I would give up my life<br>
to hold you in my arms,<br>
but after a night together,<br>
I find myself wishing<br>
that I could live forever.

君がため惜しからざりし命さへ長くもがなと思ひけるかな

Since I now recall fondly<br>
the painful days of the past,<br>
if I live long, I may look back<br>
on these harsh days, too,<br>
and find them sweet and good.

ながらへばまたこのごろやしのばれむ憂しとみし世ぞ今は恋しき

## Birthday celebration day!

Finally I've caught up to you in age!

You did a really nice job celebrating my birthday this year! You made me this cake!

![Birthday cake](/images/blog_april/birthday_cake.jpg)

It was so smooth, round, and delicious!

Then you took me to sushi! We also saw flowers:

![Kaitenzushi](/images/blog_april/kaitenzushi.gif)
![Sakura](/images/blog_april/sakura.gif)

I liked nanuuku sushi! But what is it? I looked it up on Google and didn't find anything.

After that we went stargazing, and had more cake in the car! Unfortunately this was not a good time for photos...

## First burn

Each time you answer correctly on a WaniKani item during review, a greater time passes before you have to review it again. The item goes through stages: apprentice, guru, master, enlightened, burn. Once an item hits burn, it never appears again!

The time between the review from enlightened to burned is 6 months. I just burned my first items today! (Check this blog, the first mention of WaniKani is in October, about 6 months ago!)

![Burned](/images/blog_april/burned.png)

I'm also coming up on the 1 year anniversary of me studying Japanese (it's in April). I didn't realize I had started learning kanji almost exactly 6 months in.

# 10 April
## Parents' present

I received a birthday present from my parents today! It's a charging stand for my phone:

![Phone stand 2](/images/blog_april/phone_stand2.jpg)
![Phone stand 1](/images/blog_april/phone_stand1.jpg)

(By the way, these photos were taken in the same lighting, but one with my old phone and one with my new phone. You can really tell the difference in image quality, huh...)

I was wondering if such a thing would be all that helpful, but I guess it'll make it easier to pick up my phone from the ground in the morning! It also has a neat feature to prevent notifications when the phone is on it, so they don't annoy you while sleeping. Also, it's just neat!

I think it could be cool if contact charging devices were built into various public places. Imagine if you were sitting at a table at the library or a cafe for example, and you just put your laptop or phone on the table and it automatically charges. You wouldn't have to mess with cords, or even carry your own charger!

# 9 April
## Chapter 35

Two chapters in a row! Chapter 35 is [available here](/story#３５章). English version [here](/english_story#chapter-35).

# 8 April
## Chapter 34

Last time, Alice and co. ventured into the forest on a mission to hunt the red-haired bear king, a fearsome beast that had killed many adventurers from Maginia. As they were traveling through the forest, it jumped out at them in surprise, launching them into a fight. See what happens next in chapter 34, [available here](/story#３４章). English version [here](/english_story#chapter-34).

# 7 April
## Work on the weekend

I took Friday off, but it was a bit wasted because I had to do a little bit of work today anyway. I signed up to do design reviews for the residency program I was in when I first started working. I am assigned a group that's going through that program, and I am supposed to look at the design document for their project, and provide them with suggestions and feedback. They sent me their draft document on Friday, and I have to go over it with them on Monday, so I had to look at it sometime this weekend.

It wasn't too bad though. I walked to the library, sat there, and looked through it. The library is so nice it didn't even feel like work. Plus I got my vitamin D from walking!

# 6 April
## Down vs fake down

I was searching online today to find a new down jacket, since my current one is pretty beaten up. I had to put another piece of tape on it, so I guess it's done...

Anyway, while looking for jackets online I came across some made from synthetic down rather than real down. I decided to look up the differences.

Apparently, one major benefit of synthetic down is that it holds heat well when wet. Another benefit is that it weighs less than real down, and breathes better.

The one major con is that they haven't been able to make synthetic down that is as warm as real down yet. It seems like the best synthetic down would only be as warm as real down with around 550 down rating. However, my current down jacket has a rating of 750. I thought that was a good amount, so I don't think I can get a synthetic down jacket.

Hopefully the technology improves in the future and synthetic down becomes as good as real down!

# 5 April
## robots.txt

It occurred to me I should add a _robots.txt_ file to this site. This is a special file you can add to your site that explains to search engines how to crawl your site.

You can check out the one I added by visiting [tomomilove.com/robots.txt](/robots.txt). The one I added is pretty simple. It requests all search engines to not record anything in this site. This means, for instance, tomomilove.com will never appear in Google search results.

It's possible to add more complicated instructions to a robots.txt file. You could specify that search engines are allowed to record certain pages, but not others. You could also include a _site map_, which would direct search engines to all the pages on your site. In our case though, I see no reason for the site to be publicly searchable.

# 4 April
## Origami wolf

I found this origami wolf in a conference room at work! It's made from a post-it note.

![Origami wolf 1](/images/blog_april/origami_wolf1.jpg)

I wonder who made it, and how. Maybe they folded it while bored during a meeting, but does that mean they had the design memorized? I don't think they'd be able to follow diagrams while in a meeting. I'm impressed if they had it memorized!

Anyway, I thought it was a cute design, so I looked up the instructions and made it myself!

![Origami wolf 2](/images/blog_april/origami_wolf2.jpg)

Mine didn't come out so well, though... But it was fun trying!

# 3 April
## WaniKani mods

One nice things about WaniKani is that it's built in such a way that users can easily create and share modifications for it. I recently got some and tried them out.

Here's what I tried:

- __Dark theme modification__:
![WaniKani mods](/images/blog_april/wanikani_mods.png)

- __Ignore answer button__: If you get an answer wrong during reviews, this lets you mark it correct instead. Useful if you just made a typo!

- __Hide English sentences__: When learning vocab, there are example sentences in Japanese with English translations. This mod hides the English sentences until you hover over them, giving you a chance to try to read the Japanese first.

- __Delay on incorrect answer__: Sometimes if you get an answer wrong, you accidentally press the enter key quickly without thinking about it, and go on to the next question without getting a chance to read why you got the answer wrong. This mod prevents you from going to the next question for 2 seconds after inputting a wrong answer, fixing that issue.

There were some other interesting mods I didn't try! One example was a font randomizer, that makes the kanji display using different fonts at random, giving you an opportunity to practice reading different styles.

# 2 April
## Getting outside

I've been trying to think of way I can get outside more, to help with my vitamin D deficiency.

There's not too much place to walk around my work, but we do have a rooftop patio area. I decided to go take a look.

![Rooftop patio 1](/images/blog_april/rooftop_patio1.jpg)
![Rooftop patio 2](/images/blog_april/rooftop_patio2.jpg)
![Rooftop patio 3](/images/blog_april/rooftop_patio3.jpg)

It's pretty nice! There's even a kitchen out here!

![Rooftop kitchen](/images/blog_april/rooftop_kitchen.jpg)

There's also these bocce ball courts that no one uses. You can tell because they're covered in weeds...

![Rooftop bocce](/images/blog_april/rooftop_bocce.jpg)

Actually, this whole area is typically pretty empty. Maybe more people will be here during the summer? For now though, it's a nice quiet place.

# 1 April
## Pills

So I went ahead and bought these vitamin D supplement pills.

![Vitamin D pills](/images/blog_april/vitamin_d.jpg)

I think I said this before, but it feels a bit embarrassing. Like I'm admitting that I'm not eating well enough, or getting outside enough, so I have to take these pills. But embarrassing or not, that's the reality of the situation. If these pills are good for me, I'll take them.

Actually, I've been having these for a couple of days now, and already I feel a bit healthier than before. I don't know -- I guess that's very likely to be placebo. But who knows, maybe vitamin imbalance really was contributing to me feeling unhealthy! That sort of thing really does affect people's state of mind.

# 31 March
## Penitencia Creek Park

Today we took a trip to Penitencia Creek Park. Who knew such a nice spot of green was in the middle of San Jose!

![Penitencia park 1](/images/blog_march/penitencia1.jpg)

There was a really nice creek as well.

![Penitencia park 2](/images/blog_march/penitencia2.jpg)

We saw some funny squirrels there! They ran around the ground, hid in holes, and liked to stand up straight. One of them was talking for a while, and the others would just stand and listen. I wonder what they were communicating?

I really liked this park and I want to go back!
