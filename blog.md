## Late mothers' day present

I went downtown today to get a present for my mom. Do you remember, last week I mentioned there was an event where they were selling art downtown? I should have gotten something then! They probably deliberately set it up for mothers' day, too, but I didn't notice at the time.

Anyway, today I got this dog jigsaw puzzle.

I think my mom would like it!

All the dogs on here are mixed breeds, and have funny names written next to them.

My plan was to mail it from the downtown post office immediately. However, I didn't make it, because it closed much earlier than I expected! It closed at 2:00. The post office never fails to surprise me with how much it is closed!

Anyway, now I'm not sure how I'm going to send it. I gues I have to go during work, because post office isn't open on Sunday.

## Monoliths

I found this artwork near my work:

As you can see, they are large rocks split down the middle and with binary code inside. I kind of like these actually! I like the contrast between the rough, natural surface of the rocks and the clean cut interior, and the trees complement the scene well! It's not overdone either; it's minimalist in a nice way. I think the whole thing just gives off a deeply mysterious impression, which I find sparks my imagination!

## Thoughts after playing Pokemon for a few days

I have to say, this isn't exactly the best game for practicing kanji! There is katakana everywhere, and tons of borrowed English words. I wonder, is this how people normally speak and write? Or is it just because the game is aimed at kids? On the plus side, I have gotten much faster at reading katakana!

One aspect of the game that has been difficult for me is autoscrolling text. Outside of battle the text is fine, but during battle the text automatically advances, and it's too fast for me to read a lot of the time! But maybe it will teach me to read more quickly.

This game has an interesting sidequest where you can participate in "Pokewood", Pokemon's version of Hollywood, to make movies. It's pretty elaborate, actually. You do a fight with a green screen background, and during the fight, you have to fulfill certain conditions to follow the movie script. You also have to choose the correct line to speak at certain points. Afterwards, you can go watch the movie with all the special effects filled in! It's a pretty fun mode, but the problem is, because they give you the instructions during battle, it autoscrolls, and it is too difficult follow. So I end up giving bad answers and creating failure movies!

By the way, I got this pokemon called ヨーテリー:

I named mine ミニク. It looks just like her, right?

## I like cucumbers and I like tea, but this is going a bit far

![Cucumber tea](/images/blog_may/cucumber_tea1.jpg)

So they had this new tea at work...

I've made it no secret that I dislike teas with bizarre things added to it, such as fruit. Then I saw this _cucumber_ tea. It sounded so awful I had to try it. But first, let's read the back of the box:

![Cucumber tea back of the box](/images/blog_may/cucumber_tea2.jpg)

...It's a bit dramatic. I'm not actually sure what it means by "speed-of-sound steam trains". Are there steam trains that go that fast...? I'm pretty sure not...?

Anyway, I tried the tea, and... it basically tasted like nothing. It's hard to describe, but the tea felt like it had scent, but no flavor. And it was a very generic kind of scent. I didn't really notice cucumber.

Conclusion: The tea wasn't as bad as I was expecting, but it just felt kind of pointless to me.

## Bus scare

I was riding the bus home and there was a smell of fuel. The driver stopped the bus and examined it, and it turned out there was some leaking fuel. They couldn't determine the cause but guessed the tank was overfilled or something. So they continued on the bus route.

I got scared though. Is leaking fuel safe? Could the bus, like, suddenly explode or something? I'm not sure how this works, but I imagined the worst. So I got off the bus early and walked the rest of the way home.

It wasn't too bad of a decision! I got to enjoy the sunshine on the way back. Actually, my doctor had recommended getting off the bus early and walking home as a way to get exercise. Also, I stopped by a restaurant on the way home to get dinner, a Mexican restaurant called Rincon Sabroso. It's a good place I used to go to often, but I hadn't been to recently due to it being a bit far.

## Returning to ポケットモンスターホワイト２

I returned to my playthrough of the Pokemon game you gave me, with kanji turned on this time! I actually decided to start from the beginning again, to reread the intro. And I gotta say, it was like 100x easier to read this time! This made me feel really happy, because I can tell I've made a lot of progress since I last tried to play this game. I can recognize a lot more vocab, and the various speech patterns of the different characters make a lot more sense to me now.

In a few minutes I already surpassed how far I had made it the last time. I'm really looking forward to continuing this!

## Downtown event

I ran downtown today, and the streets were closed to cars because there happened to be an event going on! I think it was called "A la carte and art". That makes it sound fancier than it is though. They just had various people selling their art goods, some food, and some music as well.

There were a lot of pretty things you could buy! I thought to myself, "I could spend my peer bonus on something here!", but I didn't. Nothing in particular stood out, and even with some free money to spend, I didn't want to make an impulse purchase.

It's really nice to have the street closed anyway, you can walk anywhere without a care in the world! You know, I think they should just always keep it closed! Turn the downtown into a giant plaza. There's no good reason cars have to go through it, right? That, or at least close it on the weekends! It would be nice!

## 世界樹の迷宮の終わりです

So I finally finished 世界樹の迷宮X, the game that Kowagarijanai Chronicles is based on!

Not sure if you've been keeping track, but I've been playing this game since August. It took me about 240 hours of playtime to beat. There's actually even more to do in the game after the ending, including an extra hard dungeon and some extra hard bosses, but I think I'm ready to move on from it now, even though I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Also, rest assured, the story Kowajarijani Chronicles will continue! Although it is pretty far away from the ending. Also, I'm planning to deviate from the game's plot significantly.

I'm thinking about what game I'd like to play in Japanese next. I have one in mind, but I think I'm going to wait until I've learned some more kanji and vocab first. In the meantime, I may return to the Pokemon game you gave me.

## Humanoid crane

I still receive emails about meetings for our old origami club. About a month ago, I received one that said they were going to make a humanoid crane. I had always wanted to build this model actually, but never thought I could find the diagrams. However, the email mentioned the original artist's name, Sasade Shinji, so I decided to go look for them.

I was able to find some low quality ones online! So I went to fold the humanoid crane! Here is what it is supposed to look like (photo not mine):

And here's mine:

It turned out all right! My only regret was not using larger paper. It was a fun build though!

## Performance rating

I received my semi-annual performance rating today. The rating I got was "exceeds expectations". Contrary to its name, this is actual the normal expected rating, because everyone is expected to exceed their role.

This is better than I had done the past two times though, so I guess it's a personal improvement. I still feel infinitely far away from a promotion though, unfortunately.

I think my primary feedback was that I need to deliver more impactful results. Ah, it's so difficult...
