# 1 January
## New Year's goals

It's a new year and here are my goals for the year!

- Learn 1000 more kanji in WaniKani! (currently I am at 241)
- Set up regular doctor's appointments, and go to one!
- Set up regular dentist's appointments, and go to one!

I think that's about it. Otherwise, I want to keep on enjoying every day to the fullest! And I want to keep on loving you as much as I can! They say that love fades over time (is it because people take each other for granted?), but that's not going to happen for me! I will keep appreciating you with all my heart! This year, and every year.
