## Doctor's visit again

Didn't think I'd be back to the doctor again so soon, but here I am. I'm happy I went on that visit earlier in the year, so I had an introductory meeting already.

I was thinking my health issue may have been improving over the last couple of days, possibly...? So I was in the awkward position of hoping that it wasn't completely fixed, so that the doctor's visit wouldn't be a waste. But that's not a good thing to hope for, you know? Anyway, I think it is not completely fixed.

Overall, I think it was a good visit. My doctor had me take a test which I'll get some results back in a few days. And she gave me some good advice about diet. So that made me feel better. Let's hope I don't have any serious problem, though!

## Work at home...

I had trouble getting work done on Friday, and couldn't really focus. I thought about retroactively marking it as vacation time, but instead, I decided to do some stuff today. It wasn't much, just writing up the midpoint evaluation for my intern. I think part of the reason was, I didn't want to write it on Friday when I was in a bad mood from being frustrated with work!

It's hard for me to think of good feedback for my intern. He is doing quite well, I don't really perceive any weaknesses in him. My primary recommendation for improvement was for him to take more initiative in interacting with some of the other members of the team. It's not something I would have expected in the first place, but if he were to develop further, I guess that would be a good area.

## Flower walk

I decided to take a picture of every kind of flower I encountered on my way to lunch, just for you! There were so many! You realize don't realize just how many there are until you have to stop to photograph each one!

## Ominous example sentence

I'm not sure if you've noticed, but I've been having a bit of a health issue over the past several weeks. I didn't think too much of it, just thought maybe it's an effect of aging or something. But last week I happened to read an example Japanese sentence that said it could be an indicator of larger problems!

I hoped it would get better, so I gave myself another week before scheduling a doctor's appointment. Anyway, it didn't get better, so I made the appointment today, for Monday. I worry about the potential cost, because I'm not even sure how to figure out the cost of appointments, and I did try my best to look. But at least it's a load off my mind for now -- it was really troubling me all week!

## Awkward mango lassi

I ate at Mamacitas taco truck, then decided to get a mango lassi at Momo Grill food truck right next to it. I haven't been to Momo Grill since the last time I posted about it, since I wasn't too impressed.

Anyway, I just went to get the mango lassi. After I ordered it, they asked me, "Have you had our food before?" And I was like, "Yes...". Then they were like, "What did you have?" And I was like, "The chicken momos...". Then they were like, "Did you not like it?" And I was like, "Uh, it's not that, I just already ate something today...". And they were like, "Of course, no worries!"

If I had to guess, they are not doing so well, and are seeking feedback. You can really tell just by looking they are not nearly as popular as Mamacitas. Unfortunately I was too taken aback at their questions in the moment to provide a good answer. But thinking about it now, I do have some feedback: I would say the momos are too plain on their own, but the sauce for them is too spicy. And overall, they don't quite feel like a complete meal.

Anyway, the mango lassi was pretty good!

## Rendaku

Are you familiar with "rendaku"?

It's a term for the process by which latter parts of some Japanese words become voiced. For example, the reason why 人々 is pronounced ひとびと, rather than ひとひと. I bet you can intuitively do rendaku very well, but did you ever study the rules explicitly?

It's always been a somewhat mysterious process to me, so today I listened to a Tofugu podcast covering the subject. Over an hour long, and they only covered the basics. I'll share some of the key findings with you. I'm curious if you ever knew these explicitly!

First, we need to distinguish between 和語 and 漢語 words, words that either originated from the original Japanese, or from Chinese (basically, kunyomi vs onyomi). _In general_, rendaku is likely to occur between compounds involving wago words, and unlikely to occur between compounds involving kango words. Why is it like that, though? It turns out, researchers have a theory:

Did you notice that essentially all wago words start with unvoiced consonants? There are some exceptions, but mostly, you won't see wago words starting with sounds like が or ぜ. Because of this, when you hear a voiced constant in a wago word, you know it isn't the start of a new word -- it has to be in the middle somewhere. Therefore, researchers theorize that in the original Japanese, rendaku was actually a way to distinguish compound words from two separate words simply being next to each other. Interesting, right?

In contrast, kango words can start with voiced consonants. Therefore, if you were to rendaku a kango word, you might change it into another valid word, which could be confusing. On the podcast, they gave the example of rendaku'ing 入学試験（にゅうがくしけん）to にゅうがくじけん. If you did that, it might get confused for another word, something like 入学事件. Therefore, kango words often don't get rendaku'd.

However, there are some kango words that do get rendaku'd. Apparently there are bunch of rules governing this, but the main one is, if the word is old enough or common enough, it's kinda treated more like a native Japanese word, and therefore gets rendaku'd. But there are cases where you wouldn't do it, and so on...

Well this blog post is getting pretty long, so I'll stop now!

## Insulation

The Blue Apron box I just received was a lot different than usual. The box was lined with ~3/4 inch thick insulation:

![Paper insulation 1](/images/blog_june/paper_insulation1.jpg)
![Paper insulation 2](/images/blog_june/paper_insulation2.jpg)

Can you tell? It's made from scraps of recycled paper! Here's a close-up, you can see brands and words and things:

![Paper insulation 3](/images/blog_june/paper_insulation3.jpg)

I've never seen anything like it before, and it's pretty cool! Yay for recycling! Next, I can recycle this insulation, too... I wonder if it will be able to be reused yet again...?

## Breaking things

Ah... today I accidentally broke the main server at my work, and it lasted for about a half hour.

Well, it wasn't entirely my fault. There was definitely a string of bad decisions that led to this. But I was the one who did the final trigger. Luckily, there is a pretty strong culture of not assigning blame.

Still, I kind of feel bad. After my mess up, a lot of other people have to get involved to analyze the impact of the problem, and exactly how much damage was caused. So I definitely wasted some of their time. Though to be honest, I'm not sure I see the point in analyzing exact impact numbers. It's already over and done with, so what are you going to do about it? You don't use the numbers to inform any future decision, as far as I'm aware.

After an incident like this, you're supposed to write a "post-mortem" doc, that basically describes what happened, and what actions you'll take in the future to prevent it. That makes sense. What I don't get about these, though, is they have _a lot_ of detail in them, like those precise impact numbers I mentioned, and also a timeline down to the minute about every little thing that happened. Again, I'm not really sure what or who this document is for. If it were a higher level summary of lessons learned, I think it'd be great to share with the team. But I'm not sure who cares to read minute-level detail.

Anyway, I suppose my lesson learned is to be more careful in the future! Even a few years into this job, I still don't understand everything.

## Understanding 和

I decided to read a little bit into that book your mother gave me, 日本人の心. I read the first chapter, 和.

To summarize this chapter, it says that the following concepts are needed to maintain 和:

- _Consideration_, you should act in a way to avoid confrontation with others.
- _Modesty_, you should downplay your own strengths.
- _Hesitation_, refrain from taking action if it might worsen the situation.
- _Place_, consider atmosphere of the situation when deciding actions to take.
- _Space_, maintain space from people in tense situations.
- _Moderation_, seek out middle road solutions rather than extreme ones.
- _Apologize first_, then explain yourself after.
- _Lobbying_, before proposing an idea in front of a group, propose it to individuals of the group in private.

It's an interesting list. The book notes that Westerners may react negatively to some of these. For example, avoiding confrontation could be seen as being distrustful, and downplaying your own strengths could be seen as being dishonest.

I can see both sides. In some sense, _Moderation_ may be key here. If you apply any of these concepts to the extreme, like _Modesty_ for example, it can become annoying.

_Lobbying_ is an interesting one. I actually do this at work, and I don't know anyone else who really does. For me, I think it comes from a place of shyness. But still, I think it is a sensible thing to do.

## QBB

I didn't have much to do today, so I decided to walk downtown and try a new restaurant for dinner. I went to QBB, "Quality Bourbons and Barbeque". I got this pulled pork plate:

![QBB](/images/blog_june/qbb.jpg)

It was pretty good! There was a fair amount of vegetables and not too much meat, so that was nice.

If I have one complaint it's that there was a bit too much sour flavor. The barbeque sauce and the pickled vegetables both had a bit of a sour flavor. However, the cornbread was a good way to break that up. Also, the cornbread came with maple syrup butter, which is as good as it sounds, so that was nice!

Overall, I think I'd be willing to return here! I was pretty happy with the proportions and the flavors!

## Chapter 42

The next chapter of Kowagarijanai Chronicles is here! Alice is friends are traveling through a jungle on their journey to reach the World Tree. At the same time, they're keeping in mind a request from Princess Persephone to look for a missing adventurer who seems to have gotten lost somewhere in the jungle.

Anyway, read the next chapter [here](/story#４２章)! English version [here](/english_story#chapter-42).

## Industrial garden

A new building for my work opened up nearby and it has a kind of industrial theme. I decided to take a look around.

First, outside the building, you can see this broken wall:

![Broken wall 1](/images/blog_june/broken_wall1.jpg)
![Broken wall 2](/images/blog_june/broken_wall2.jpg)

It's deliberately done that way to be artistic. See, once you go through the broken wall, you come to this area:

![Industrial garden 1](/images/blog_june/industrial_garden1.jpg)
![Industrial garden 2](/images/blog_june/industrial_garden2.jpg)
![Industrial garden 3](/images/blog_june/industrial_garden3.jpg)

I'm not sure if you can tell from the photos, but this is actually a lunch area! I think the imagined scenario is that you snuck into an old abandoned factory through a broken wall. It's kind of a cute concept for a design theme I think!

Inside the building is also designed with an old industrial theme. Here's a library area:

![Industrial library 1](/images/blog_june/industrial_library1.jpg)

It has some cool old stuff around, like this phone, typewriter, and camera!

## Goodbye Kolkhida

Kolkhida food truck didn't show up yesterday or today. That's the Georgian one that used to be by Milk Pail. Since Milk Pail is closing, they moved to another location nearby a couple of weeks ago.

I checked their Facebook page which usually has news, and it was deleted...

So I called them. The owner answered and told me they were "making some changes". He said they're no longer open to the public, and only do catering now.

I'm so disappointed! I used to look forward to getting food there every week. And the tarragon soda was so good and unique! I really wanted you to try it at some point, just to get your reaction.

I wonder what happened. Maybe the new location after Milk Pail wasn't working out for them. Even I could tell it wasn't a good location. But they could have looked for another place, right...?

But maybe they found a job serving lunch for tech companies or something? Maybe that's more lucrative for them? I wonder.

I remember the owner told me his dream of opening a restaurant some day. I wonder if he's now closer or further away from that goal. I'm wishing him the best! It must be difficult!

## New laptop... again

The other day I mentioned that my laptop had an issue with the space bar entering multiple spaces. So I went to the tech support at my work to ask for help. They didn't even ask me any questions, and just immediately ordered me another one! I guess they've seen it a bunch, and it's a common problem...

My new laptop just arrived and I spent about an hour or so setting it up again.

The keyboard seems to work, but the other one did too, at first. I'm not sure how to tell early on whether or not it is faulty! I guess I have to put my keyboard through some stress testing, and type a whole heck of a lot! Hopefully that's not what breaks it!

Earlier I mentioned I was thinking of getting a new laptop for home, but now, that thought is completely out of my mind. My current laptop works perfectly fine, and for that reason, I don't want to risk replacing it and ending up with more issues. Do you remember, the first Pixel phone I bought had issues too? I'm not sure if I have really bad luck, or if getting new technology is just a struggle in general!

## Hat pocket

Did you know my sun hat has a pocket in it? It's on the underside of the roof of the hat:

![Hat pocket](/images/blog_june/hat_pocket.jpg)

See the horizontal line across? It's a velcro pocket!

I wonder what it's intended for? Having no better ideas, I decided to put a note in there, saying my name and email address, and to contact me if you found the hat. That could help if I lose it, right? But the problem is, if someone finds the hat, I doubt anyone would notice the pocket and find the note...

What else could I put in there? I could put some money, to pull out in an emergency. I could put a picture of a rabbit, to pull out as a magic trick. I could put a secret note to you, telling you that I love you!

# 9 June
## T-shirt weather

It's been hot! I'm not sure if I'm getting weaker as I get older, but I feel less tolerant of it than I used to be! During my Davis days, heat wouldn't bother me at all, in fact, I associate it with fond memories of summer!

Today though, I did the unthinkable and actually couldn't even wear my collared shirt. I had to wear a t-shirt. It's not really my style, but I guess I've come to the point where I value comfort. I guess I'll probably end up doing this on the weekends now...

# 8 June
## Hike and party day

We got up early to go hiking today!

![Black mountain](/images/blog_june/black_mountain.jpg)

The hike was pretty nice! I liked the wide, gentle meadows of grass we saw. It looks really fun to run around in. The hike didn't seem too tough for me, but later that day I had a pretty bad headache, so I wonder if I overdid it? Do you know, is heat something you can get used to? If you train and become healthier, will it not affect you as much?

Afterwards we went to Milk Pail's going away party. I already mentioned this, but I'm really going to miss them! Anyway, there were some nice things at the party: we did cheese tasting, got ice cream, listened to a singing group, saw the owner and his daughters, and signed a note for the store! I didn't know what to expect going into the party, although I was half-hoping they would just be offering up large amounts of unsold food from the store, like free ice cream for example...?! Though I guess that was a bit of an unrealistic expectation!

# 7 June
## Beautiful packagings

You gave me these snacks with nice packagings from Japan. I've been holding on to them because it seemed a shame to throw them out. But I guess it's not good to hold on to this stuff, otherwise it will just start piling up after a while...

It's good to preserve in photos though! Let's do this!

## Chocolate soup...

Continuing my quest to find the best hot chocolate, I was informed by a coworker of a new candidate. Apparently, my building sometimes has hot chocolate at breakfast! I didn't know this at all... and the reason was, they serve it from the containers usually used for soup for some reason?? And the only way to get it out is awkwardly with the soup ladle. And there aren't any cups nearby, only the soup bowls...

![Chocolate soup](/images/blog_june/chocolate_soup.jpg)

Yup, there it is in the soup bowl.

Anyway, I tried it, and it wasn't that good! It was kind of watery, not thick like you like it, nor fluffy like I like it. My search for the best hot chocolate continues!

# 5 June
## Crazy sprinklers!

As I came home from dinner today, I discovered the sprinklers outside going crazy! They were spraying in every direction at high power, flooding the sidewalk. One wasn't even spraying, just gushing out water. And one was spraying super high! I tried to take a picture:

![Sprinkler](/images/blog_june/sprinkler.jpg)

It's hard to see the water in the picture, so I circled the height that it reached. It was even hitting the top of the tree! I've never see anything like it before.

# 4 June
## Old teammate

One of our old teammates who left the company came to visit for lunch today! They were here for a conference but had some free time at lunch.

They seemed exactly the same as before! It's funny how it's like that with people. You don't see them for a while and then when you see them again, they are exactly the same.

Unfortunately, I didn't get to talk very much with this old teammate. The lunch table was pretty long, and they were on the other end of it compared to me. Too bad!

# 3 June
## Gin gins

They had this new candy at work I decided to try!

![Gin gins](/images/blog_june/gin_gins.jpg)

Part of the reason I decided to try it is that the name was cute!

Anyway, it was really gingery, as you might expect! And really chewy as well. My first thought when I put it in my mouth was "Is this even food??", because it was so chewy. Overall it was pretty good, but I probably won't eat it again! Candy isn't the best use of sugar, so I have a pretty high bar for any candy I would eat.

# 2 June
## Valley of the Sun

We took a chill day downtown today! But I was so wrapped up in it I forgot to take photos!

We started it off with ramen at Shalala. I got the shoyu tonkotsu and it was really intense! It was extremely garlicky, and that's even considering you took a bunch from me. And a very high amount of bean sprouts. It was pretty good but a bit too much for me! Maybe a half-sized order with a side would have been better...?

After that we discovered that the gelato place downtown had reopened! I'm not sure what the exact situation is, but it looks refreshed and ready to be carried over by the next generation. I thought it was inspiring!

Finally, we worked on a puzzle at the library! The title of the puzzle was "Valley of the Sun", and I wasn't sure where it was supposed to be exactly. But looking up that term on Google, it seems to be Phoenix, Arizona. We made a ton of progress on the puzzle but didn't quite finish. It got me thinking though: Are there people out there who do puzzles quickly as a competition, I wonder? I've never heard of such a thing, but I bet there are some people who would get really into it...

# 1 June
## Suddenly San Francisco

Today you called me out suddenly to meet you in San Francisco!

Riding the train and BART there, I thought about how it had been so long since I had last done so. It's pretty easy to get there, but such a hassle to get back, which is why I was thankful you offered to drive me back!

Once there we had hot chocolate of course!

![Hot chocolate](/images/blog_june/hot_chocolate.jpg)

On my quest to find good hot chocolate, this is probably the best. I like the bigger and lighter one, but the small and dense one is good too!

While we were in San Francisco, we did some walking as well. I thought this building was cool!

![SF building](/images/blog_june/sf_building.jpg)

I like the colors, as well as the round portion on the corner, almost like a tower. I wish I had a round room with windows all around!
