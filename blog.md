## Surprise Tomomi
You already know what happened today, but I thought I'd record it for memory's sake.

That's right, you showed up without warning to come over! I think I mentioned that I dreamed about that happening the previous night, so you really made my dreams come true!

One fun thing is that we were able to cook the Blue Apron meal I received today. It was beef over curry-spiced rice with cream cilantro sauce.

![Curry-spiced rice](/images/blog_september/curry_spiced_rice.jpg)

You liked the cilantro sauce quite a bit. I think it had cilantro, onions, garlic, oil, lime juice, and pepper in it. Then we mixed it with sour cream and more lime juice.

## Finished 428: Shibuya Scramble
Earlier I mentioned I had been playing a game called 428: Shibuya Scramble. Today I finished it! So I'll provide some complete thoughts.

As I mentioned before, the game is almost entirely just reading. But it's not boring; the story is quite thrilling and action packed.

There's a lot to like about this game. In the earlier parts of the story, it is lighter-hearted, and the moments of humor land well. In the latter parts of the story, it becomes more serious, and emotional. In the final chapters, I was crying constantly. Even though there is no voice acting, the strength of the writing and some good music choice allow the emotional moments to really hit home.

One interesting thing is that the story takes place over the course of a single day, and each chapter corresponds to a single hour. Scenes in the game are actually noted down to the minute they occur. The minute-by-minute approach really sells the idea of how deeply the actions of the characters are linked. How one character taking a few minutes longer to do something might affect another character in a totally different scenario, for example. Fundamentally, this is a story about the connections between people. In the end, every single character matters somehow, and does something important.

The story takes place entirely in Shibuya, and I found it interesting how people in the story refer to it as a town, and as their home. I know that the districts of Tokyo actually are separate towns (or something like that, right?), but as a tourist you don't really get a sense of them as whole towns. Maybe you visit the central landmarks, the shopping districts, etc, but you don't really get to learn what the rest of the town is really like. One interesting thing I learned in the game is that there is actually a river in Shibuya called Shibuya River. Cool, right? I don't think I would have ever found it just as a tourist:

![Shibuya river](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Shibuya_River_01.jpg)

Oh by the way, if you're interested in the story, we could go through it together sometime. I think I would enjoy reading it again. Just throwing it out there as something fun we could do!

## Counseling appointment 2
I went to my second counseling appointment today. I didn't write about the last one one the blog before because I figured I should let you know in person for that time.

I'm not sure what to think of these appointments. They don't resolve my worries per se, but the counselor asks me questions that I should have been asking myself, which I think is helpful.

I would write more about what we talked about the appointment, but I guess it's too sensitive for a blog post, so I'd rather tell you in person. If you're interested, ask me about it some time!

# 26 September
## Next story chapter
It's a bit of a shorter one today. I guess I have been procrastinating on it a little bit, maybe because the writing is becoming difficult for me.

Anyway, read the next chapter of the story [here](/story#１５章)!

## California General Election Official Voter Information Guide
Recently I received the California General Election Official Voter Information Guide in the mail, and today I decided to take a look through it:

![Voter guide](/images/blog_september/voter_guide.jpg)

It contains descriptions of the propositions and candidates being voted on in November.

Anyway, I'll highlight a couple of the more interesting propositions for you.

_Prop 7_ gives the California legislature the ability to change daylight savings (currently, changes to daylight savings require voter approval). However, no matter what, Calfornia is still bound by federal daylight savings laws.

This is a bit of bizarre proposition because it basically does nothing. The problem is that federal daylight savings laws are quite strict: pretty much your only choice is to do spring/summer daylight savings, or to do no daylight savings at all. What people really want though is year-round daylight savings, but this isn't currently allowed under federal law. As a result, this proposition won't really accomplish anything unless the federal law changes at some point in the future.

_Prop 11_ requires private-sector ambulance employees to be on-call even during breaks. I guess the current situation is that when these employees are on breaks, they cannot be interrupted for 911 calls or anything.

First of all, I didn't even know private ambulances existed, and are distinct from public ambulances. So I guess I learned something there.

This proposition is difficult for me to know what the right thing is. It seems reasonable enough, since it mentions that employees will be paid and get additional break time if their break gets interrupted. But the devil is in the details, maybe there are problems I haven't noticed, and it's hard for me to know what these employees really want.

I feel that way about most of the propositions, actually. Most of them basically take the form "Have the California government spend X amount of money to support Y project." The project may sound good, but the implementation details matter, and it's hard for me to predict how things will really turn out. 

As a result, I really don't know what to vote for most of these propositions. Even after reading the voter guide, I still feel kind of in the dark!

## Better search
The search functionality on this website has been changed. Why don't you try it out?

The reason for the change is primarily because I didn't want to use Google Site Search, since that had ads. This is supposed to be a beautiful personal website of love, so it can't have silly ads, right?

There are some other benefits as well. For example, I was able to get the search results to match the style of the website (fonts and colors), which makes the whole experience prettier and more elegant. Also, this code was a lot easier to work with than Google Site Search.

One drawback is that this search doesn't seem to be able to handle Japanese characters at all. That's something I could potentially fix on another day, though it would require a lot of effort with only marginal benefit.

So anyway, if this search engine doesn't come from Google, where does it come from? I didn't code it myself. It's called "Tipue Search" (not really sure why), and I got it from [this Github project](https://github.com/jekylltools/jekyll-tipue-search).

You might be wondering: Is it really okay for me to take someone else's code and stick it in my own website? Doesn't that violate copyright or something?

That's why you have to read the software license. In this case, it says:

"Copyright (c) 2017 Nick

Basically, you can use it for anything you want, as long as you keep this license declaration with it. That's fairly common in the software world, and it's a real blessing!

## Recycling the Blue Apron box
Yesterday I received my first Blue Apron shipment, and cooked it. Today, I had to get rid of the box.

![Blue apron box](/images/blog_september/blue_apron_box.jpg)

It really is quite big, isn't it?

![Blue apron insulation](/images/blog_september/blue_apron_insulation.jpg)

It contains insulation, two ice packs, and plastic bags/containers to hold each of the ingredients.

My immediate thought was to worry about creating a lot of waste. However, there are instructions on the Blue Apron website about how to dispose of things, and it seems like they have it pretty well covered.

The box and paper stuff can be recycled, of course.

The insulation is said to be biodegradable. I guess you still gotta throw it away, though.

The ice packs are said to be safe to be thawed and then poured out.

The various plastic bags are said to be recyclable. However, they aren't #1 or #2, so I wasn't sure if they could be recycled. I decided to look it up, and I learned something interesting. From the Mountain View city website:

"Recycle by number?

"Those triangle and number symbols printed on many plastics are the manufacturer's identification code for the type of resin in the plastic, similar to a nutrition label on a food can.  The recycling symbols are not indicators that something is recyclable in any given community.

"What changed?  When recycling began in the 1990's, numbers were often used to help the public identify what was recyclable.  With more complex product packaging and world-wide manufacturing, we are moving away from using the numbers to identify what is recyclable.  All you need to do is ask yourself a simple question about the plastic item.

"Is this plastic item a bottle, tub or jug?  If yes, recycle--if no, trash.  Again, what is accepted for recycling depends on the market value.  End markets want to buy plastic bottles, tubs and jugs.  Markets do not want these hard-to-recycle plastics that have no value."

Honestly, I did not know that at all. I thought number determined what you could recycle, but I guess my information was outdated. Hopefully the kids these days are learning the correct thing!

## A stellar shirt
The last shirt I got may have been a miss, but I just got another one which is totally bliss:

![Stellar shirt](/images/blog_september/stellar_shirt.jpg)

It's a navy blue color with little white dots. To me, it looks like stars, which I really like. Actually, to be honest, it has been my secret desire for the longest time to get a shirt with stars. And this one is perfect! It's not too crazy or cheesy looking. I think it hits a good balance of cool and sophisticated. Also I like the buttons, they kind of look like moons to me. I think it's my new favorite shirt!

Here's a detail shot!
![Stellar shirt detail](/images/blog_september/stellar_shirt_detail.jpg)

# 21 September
## Lucky soda
Do you remember when we had lunch at the food trucks at my work? If you recall, there was a soda machine there:

![Soda machine](/images/blog_september/soda_machine.jpg)

I believe the soda is made right here. There are these cannisters in a refrigerator below the soda machine, I guess they store the sodas, and I'm wondering if they are responsible for creating the fizz, too?

![Soda cannisters](/images/blog_september/soda_cannisters.jpg)

Anyway, although this soda machine may be neat, it frequently has problems. There are various things that can go wrong:

- The soda has no fizz. This is bad because it is too dense and syrupy like this. It needs the fizz to be lighter.
- The wrong flavors are hooked up to the wrong nozzle.
- It's empty.

Actually, the majority of the time I try this soda machine, at least one of these problems is present. In fact, I estimate that I only actually get a perfectly correct soda ~25% of the time!

Huh... what's this?
![Soda](/images/blog_september/soda.jpg)

A perfect soda! Lucky day!

# 20 September
## Surprise shirt
So, some months ago I ordered a shirt online. It was still in pre-production at that point; they hadn't actually manufactured it yet. There was just a promise to deliver it later.

Anyway, I had completely forgotten about it until two days ago, when I received a notification that it was shipping out. Nice!

Here's a photo. I guess the lighting isn't great, but trust me when I say that I really like its green color.

![Surprise shirt 1](/images/blog_september/surprise_shirt1.jpg)

Here's a detail shot. I like the pattern with the little dots.

![Surprise shirt 2](/images/blog_september/surprise_shirt2.jpg)

Interestingly enough, the dots aren't a print; they are actually sewn in! Here's the inside of the shirt, you can see the threads that make the dots.

![Surprise shirt 3](/images/blog_september/surprise_shirt3.jpg)

Unfortunately, those backside threads make the shirt feel scratchy inside. So I think I will have to return it!

# 19 September
## Intern aspirations
Today I put in an application to have an intern! It's something I always wanted to do, but didn't feel ready for before. Also, I lucked out this time, because I didn't miss the email that called for intern applications. I get so overflooded with emails that sometimes I miss important ones, haha...

I'm not sure what the chances of getting an intern are. I heard they were fairly good, as sometimes there are sometimes more interns than projects available. However, one difficulty I face is that working on my team requires knowledge of the programming language C++. I bet many students don't know it. Although C++ is (or was) a popular language, it's also notoriously difficult, and I think most students these days are learning things like Python instead.

Choosing an intern project is pretty difficult. The intern doesn't show up until summer, so it has to be something you don't plan to do until then. And an intern can't be relied on to do anything too important; I hear that interns can be pretty hit or miss in terms of how much they get done. But the project also needs to be interesting. No intern wants to do boring grunt work.

That said, I think I managed to come up with an interesting project. It's the kind of project that I would want to do. It's a fun problem for sure, not grunt work. It has clear goals, but also some room for open-endedness and creativity. It should be easy to make some concrete progress in it, but it can become extremely difficult to finish it completely, or do it very well. So I think any intern could get at least something done, but there is also room for an exceptional intern to show off.

# 18 September
## Blue Apron
I decided to try out that Blue Apron program roommate B was doing a little while ago. Do you remember, the one where they send you food with some recipes? The first shipment is on Saturday.

I decided to try it for a few reasons.

- Cheaper than eating out. (Although not _that_ much cheaper than eating out.)
- I get to have a greater variety of food than just eating at the same restaurants all the time.
- Recipe ideas. If I find some good ones, maybe I can save them and make them later.
- Cooking will be fun, maybe?

Anyway, I'll try it out for a couple of weeks and see how it goes. Each meal they send you is meant for two people, so you'll have to try it with me sometime!

## Character profile: Alice

Here's a character profile on Alice, the character from _Kowagarijanai Chronicles_. It covers her life prior to the beginning of the story. This is meant to be just a quick and fun bonus, so I've only written it in English. I may do some of the other characters later, as well.

**Full name:** Alice Hitomi Smith

**Age:** 21 years old.

**Personality:** Serious, competent, distrustful of others. Acts sarcastically towards people she doesn’t respect (due to their incompetence). Puts on a face of confidence, but internally is actually quite indecisive.

**Biography:** She is a small-time hero of her home city.

As a child, she lived a fairly ordinary life, though she was quiet and somewhat awkward. One day when she was 16, she happened to be looking through things belonging to her literature teacher Mrs. Tanaka, when she found a magical sword. She asked Tanaka if she could use it to fight off a gang that had been harassing her and her friends at school. Tanaka agreed to let Alice have it. With Tanaka’s help, Alice successfully defeated the gang.

Since then, Alice has worked as the town’s local hero, and has fought off many threats and evildoers. She is mentored by Tanaka, who was the town’s previous hero.

Alice’s policy as a hero is to always fight in the open, in broad daylight, and she welcomes a civilian audience. In her words: “The only way I can be sure that I fight for justice is if my actions are fully transparent to the people.”

**Motivation for exploring Yggdrasil:** It is said that hidden at the top of Yggrasil there is a treasure that can grant any wish. Alice reasons that she can increase her impact as a hero to a global scale if she finds the treasure and wishes for world peace.

**Things she likes:** She’s a big fan of the legendary Luxendarc guild, the only people known in recent history to have summited Yggdrasil. Fun fact: I think earlier I mentioned that I played the previous game in this series. Luxendarc guild was my guild from that game.

**Things she worries about:** She is insecure about being a small-time hero. Other heroes she has met outside her city don’t seem to take her seriously.

**People she is close to:** Her former language teacher and current mentor, Mrs. Tanaka. Her mother, Himari Smith. A small group of friends from her school days.

**Fighting style:** A frontline fighter who doesn’t know the word “retreat”. She wields both a sword and a shield, and can take on both an offensive and a defensive role. You might think that doing both offense and defense would leave her only half as good at each, but actually, she just works twice as hard and is fully competent at both. Her work ethic is so intense, people say that when she fights it is almost as if she is two people.

# 16 September
## Chai try
I tried my hand at making some masala chai today! My goal was to replicate the kind that is commonly found at Indian restaurants.

What separates this tea from other milk tea is the use of spices. I looked at various recipes online, and decided that the bare minimum spices I needed to include were cardamom and cinnamon:

![Cardamom and cinnamon](/images/blog_september/cardamom_and_cinnamon.jpg)

To be honest, I had no idea what caradmom was before this. Now I've learned it's a kind of pod thing. Apparently, there are two varieties: green and black. The green variety is typically used in sweet dishes, whereas the black variety is more pungent and used in savory dishes like curry. Anyway, the green one has a distinct sweet smell, and once I smelled it I could immediately tell this is a big contributor to masala chai's unique flavor.

![Crushed cardamom and cinnamon](/images/blog_september/crushed_cardamom_and_cinnamon.jpg)

The instructions online said to crush them a little bit. Maybe it helps them release their flavor?

The next step is to put the spices in a mixture of 8 oz water and 4 oz milk, and heat until simmering.

![Simmering milk](/images/blog_september/simmering_milk.jpg)

Then add about 1 tablespoon of tea, reduce heat to low, and steep for 3 - 4 minutes.

![Steeping tea](/images/blog_september/steeping_tea.jpg)

Next we gotta strain it into a cup:

![Cup with strainer](/images/blog_september/cup_with_strainer.jpg)

Finally, mix in about 1 tablespoon of sugar. Then we're done!

![Masala chai](/images/blog_september/masala_chai.jpg)

It was pretty good! However, the flavor is a bit lacking compared to the ones I've had at restaurants. I wonder if I need stronger tea, or to steep longer? Or, maybe I need more or different spices. Some recipes I saw recommended spices like star anise or fennel seeds. I wonder what would be good...

# 15 September
## The adventurers tire
Last week, Alice and company spent their first day exploring the labyrinth, and fought a monster. Read the next chapters of their adventure [here](/story#１２章)!

# 14 September
## Gochi

![Gochi 1](/images/blog_september/gochi1.jpg)

The two work teammates I mentioned earlier actually left the team today. We had a goodbye lunch at the Mountain View restaurant Gochi. It's a Japanese tapas restaurant. Didn't you tell me you had gone there...? Or was it somewhere else?

Anyway, while there we didn't order individual dishes. Instead, we just had them bring us various foods. And there was way too much! Anyway, here they were:

![Gochi 2](/images/blog_september/gochi2.jpg)
_Edamame! Yeah, that's pretty basic._

![Gochi 3](/images/blog_september/gochi3.jpg)
_Raw (?) shrimp. Wasn't a huge fan of this one, actually!_

![Gochi 4](/images/blog_september/gochi4.jpg)
_Sashimi, I think? Do you know what fish this is? My teammates were saying salmon, but I thought salmon looked different, unless this is some kind of variety._

![Gochi 5](/images/blog_september/gochi5.jpg)
_Some kind of kimchi pork dish._

![Gochi 6](/images/blog_september/gochi6.jpg)
_Some kind of orange chicken dish._

![Gochi 7](/images/blog_september/gochi7.jpg)
_A pizza... with some kind of crab and other seafood in it._

![Gochi 8](/images/blog_september/gochi8.jpg)
_Some beef. What are those things on top?? I tried to eat one, but they were very tough._

![Gochi 9](/images/blog_september/gochi9.jpg)
_A ball that had cheese, mushroom, and I think risotto inside? I didn't try this one, because of the mushroom..._

![Gochi 10](/images/blog_september/gochi10.jpg)
_A gratin._

![Gochi 11](/images/blog_september/gochi11.jpg)
_Ending rice!_

Correct me if I'm wrong, but this isn't very traditional Japanese food, is it? It seemed kind of fusion-y to me. But I don't really know.

# 13 September
## Calling a friend
(Friend's name ommitted for privacy. It's mutual friend CYI.)

Today I called my friend on the phone. It's been so long since I talked to him. I meant to call him on his birthday a while ago, but I didn't for some reason, and then I kept putting it off. You know how I am about being nervous with phone calls. But I also called you today, so maybe I'm getting used to it, and it's not so bad!

He seems to be doing well. He's doing research now, but says he kind of misses working with patients. He says he may come back to Sacramento to finish his med school. Then we can hang out with him again!

He also told me that he participated in a triathlon recently. Apparently he trained 1 - 2 hours a day, about 6 days a week for it. That's crazy! He said something like (paraphrasing), "I used to be that fat kid, but now I'm healthy!" So that's your feel-good story of the day!

Though every time someone says that, I start thinking about myself. Do I need to exercise, haha...?

# 12 September
## Roommate and Dragon Quest 11
(Roommate's name ommitted for privacy. It's roommate K.)

So, some days ago I had a dream that my roommate told me he was quitting playing video games. I think the reason had something to do with his girlfriend not wanting him to play games anymore, if I remember correctly? Anyway, I have no idea where this dream came from, or why. I don't recall thinking about anything of the sort prior to that dream.

Anyway, I mentioned this to my roommate and he said he thought it was quite ironic, because on that very day the game _Dragon Quest 11_ released. Dragon Quest is my roommate's favorite game series, and he said he had been waiting for this entry for 14 years\*.

_\*He probably meant this in reference to Dragon Quest 8, which released in 2004. Dragon Quest 9 and 10 released in the interim, but they weren't really what fans were looking for, since they were kind of spinoffs that eschewed from the traditional game structure that the Dragon Quest series had been known for._

After I told roommate K about the dream, roommate B chimed in and said next time I have a dream, I should go do exactly the opposite. I wonder if that's good advice!

Anyway, it has been several days since then, so today I asked roommate K what he thinks of Dragon Quest 11 so far, and if it has lived up to his expectations. He said he's about 2/3 of the way through the game, and to my surprise, he said it has exceeded his expectations and is now his favorite game of all time!

Wow! Imagine having 14 years of expectations surpassed! That's your feel-good story of the day, for sure!

# 11 September
## Funny phishing domains
As I mentioned earlier, part of my job is identifying phishing links. I manually look through these all the time, and honestly, it's often quite amusing. Some of the links are just so on-the-nose about the website they're spoofing, while others are funny because they're just so bizarre. Today I looked through over 1000. I wish I could share them with you, but I guess that's not public information. So instead I'll share some I found on a [PhishTank](https://www.phishtank.com/), a public database of known phishing links. Presented without comment, I can only imagine what some of these are supposed to be about...

## Kibi comes to visit
Today I brought Kibi to visit your house.

![Kibi in the couch](/images/blog_september/kibi_in_the_couch.jpg)
_Hi Tomomi! Here I am! Coming out of your couch!_

Kibi made a bunch of new friends, such as this girl:
![Kibi and the girl](/images/blog_september/kibi_and_the_girl.jpg)
_Nice kimono you've got there! I want one!_

And these fish:
![Kibi and the fish](/images/blog_september/kibi_and_the_fish.jpg)
_I am a hermit crab. Let me in the tank!_

Kibi also decided to become a tiger cub for day:
![Kibi and the tiger](/images/blog_september/kibi_and_the_tiger.jpg)
_I feel safe in your arms, tiger~_

Then decided to see what being food was like!
![Kibi is food](/images/blog_september/kibi_is_food.jpg)
_I better be as tasty as my namesake!_

Rolling with Koron:
![Kibi and Koron](/images/blog_september/kibi_and_koron.jpg)
_コロコロコロ。。。_

And Kibi even got into a fight!
![Kibi's fight](/images/blog_september/kibis_fight.jpg)
_My claws are sharper than your silly looking weapon!_

Dinner time!
![Kibi's dinner](/images/blog_september/kibis_dinner.jpg)
_Ramen!!_

I'm not sure what Kibi's doing now...
![Kibi will endure](/images/blog_september/kibi_will_endure.jpg)
_I will endure!_

Kibi wants to finish off the day with some gaming!
![Kibi gaming 1](/images/blog_september/kibi_gaming1.jpg)
_I'm going to win!! I'm going to beat you!!_

Uh, Kibi...? You do realize this is a cooperative game, right?
![Kibi gaming 2](/images/blog_september/kibi_gaming2.jpg)
_How do I win?!_

The long day comes to a close, and now it's time for Kibi's favorite game: hide-and-go-seek! Where could he be?

## 428: Shibuya Scramble
Recently I've been playing a game called _428: Shibuya Scramble_. 

![Shibuya Scramble](http://spike-chunsoft.com/428/img/keyart.jpg)

The genre of this game is called visual novel. As the name suggests, primarily it's just a story that you read, along with pictures, music, and some sound effects. In this game, the pictures are actually photos, not drawings or computer graphics, which is fairly rare among games.

Since this is a game, there is also some interactivity: at certain points, you can choose actions for the characters to take, which changes what happens in the story. 

There are 5 main characters, and each has their own storyline. Choices you make for one character often impact the other characters. Each of the characters is either directly or indirectly related to the game's central plot, which is about a kidnapping that happens in Shibuya. For example, one of the characters is a detective on the case, and you follow him trying to resolve the kidnapping. Other characters are less directly related to the kidnapping plot. For example, one of the characters is a woman dressed up in a mascot costume working to advertise for a weight loss product in order to make some quick money. Her story is not directly related to the core plot (so far, as far as I can tell), but the choices she makes do impact what happens to the other characters, which is always interesting to see.

It's a very interesting game so far. I'll let you know more about what I think of it when I've finished!

## Alviso trip!
Today we took a trip to some parks in Alviso. Honestly I didn't even know Alviso existed before today, so that was interesting. The parks were nice as well!
![Alviso 1](/images/blog_september/alviso1.jpg)
![Alviso 2](/images/blog_september/alviso2.jpg)
![Alviso 3](/images/blog_september/alviso3.jpg)

I really liked this building, too. I think it's beautiful.

![Alviso 4](/images/blog_september/alviso4.jpg)
![Alviso 5](/images/blog_september/alviso5.jpg)

Did you notice that I like these kind of short, brown looking buildings? I guess it's their more natural and humble look that I appreciate. This building also seems to have a cool upper floor lookout. I want to try it!

# 7 September
## Haircut + Zareen's trip!
Today I got a haircut! The instructions I give to the person who cuts my hair is "Number 3 on the sides, and about 1 inch left on top". Number 3 refers to the length of razor, I think. I'm guessing you don't give instructions like that when you get your hair cut, huh?

The haircut truck only comes to the main campus of my work, not the campus that my desk is at. So whenever I get a haircut I also make sure to take a trip to the Indian restaurant Zareen's, which is nearby! 

Zareen's is an eclectic place. I think we should definitely go there together one day! Remind me the next time we are thinking of going out to dinner. 

One odd thing they have is a shelf of books.

I wonder if anyone actually reads them...?

## Leaving teammates
This week two of my teammates at work announced they are leaving the team. One is going to another team, the other to another company. One of them is a huge loss for the team, as they were always really helpful to me and everyone. The other I didn't interact with much, since they were working on a fairly peripheral project. So peripheral, in fact, that I wonder if it will continue after they leave.

No matter how many times people leave, I never get used to it. Usually what happens is that the person sends an email, and then they are gone within a week. It always makes me feel bad when this happens: I guess because it's so sudden, and it feels so cold and emotionless. I feel like I want to be able to talk to them, reason with them, and convince them to stay, but of course that is impossible. By the time they've sent the email, the plans are already well in motion, the offers already signed, and so on.

Whenever a teammate leaves, I always wonder if I played a small part in it. If I had been nicer to them, more sociable, would they have stayed? Maybe I alone couldn't have changed anything, but still, perhaps I could have played a better role than I did. I resolve to try to be nicer to my remaining teammates.

## Fast internet
So I splurged to get ethernet, and I think it was a good decision! It has been so far, so good today.

Look, Google even describes my internet as _fast_ now!

I should have done this ages ago! Honestly, I wonder why I never considered it? I guess because I didn't even know powerline adapters existed.

## _Poems of Friendship_
I finally got around to reading this book. I can't quite remember when or why I received it. Did Tammy and Rachel give it to me? Was it for my birthday, or for some other reason?

![Poems of Friendship](/images/blog_september/poems_of_friendship.jpg)

There were some nice poems in here. I already ready you my two favorites. One of them, _Friendship_ by Dinah Maria Mulock Craik, says that a friend should do the following for all the things their friend says:

    "Take and sift them--
    Keep what is worth keeping--
    And with the breath of kindness
    Blow the rest away."

Kind of harsh, but not necessarily bad advice!

Another, _My Familiar_ by John Godfrey Saxe, complains of a friend who stays too long. It contains some witty couplets like:

    He takes the strangest liberties,--
        But never takes his leave!"

and

    "He opens everything he sees--
        Except the entry door!"
    
Here's another one I liked. It's _Friendship_ by Ella Wheeler Wilcox:

    "Dear friend, I pray thee, if thou wouldst be proving
        Thy strong regard for me,
    Make me no vows. Lip service is not loving;
        Let thy faith speak for thee.

    Swear not to me that nothing can divide us--
        So little such oaths mean.
    But when distrust and envy creep bseide us,
        Let them not come between.

    Say not to me the depths of thy devotion
        Are deepter than the sea;
    But watch, lest doubt or some unkind emotion
        Embitter them for thee.

    Vow not to love me ever and forever,
        Words are such idle things;
    But when we differ in opinions, never
        Hurt me by little stings.

    I'm sick of words: they are so lightly spoken,
        And spoken, are but air.
    I'd rather feel they trust in me unbroken
        Than list thy words so fair.

    If all the little proofs of trust are heeded,
        If thou art always kind,
    No sacrifice, no promise will be needed
        To satisfy my mind."

I want to take this one to heart. I tell you I love you a lot, but I want it to be more than words.

I haven't read poetry in a long time -- probably never since school? I found it nice to read some now, though. Sometimes poetry gets a bad rap for being boring or obtuse, but I think a good poem can delight with it's structure and word choice. For example, the poem about the friend who never goes away is a lot of fun because of its repetitive and rhythmic structure.

## Los Altos day!
A day where both of us were free to have fun! We took a trip (well, a walk) to Los Altos!

No trip to Los Altos is complete without going to Satura Cakes! Although this time, we didn't get a cake, just a peach soda.

![Peach soda](/images/blog_september/peach_soda.jpg)

It was pretty good! A little syrupy at first, but it was good after the ice melted a little. I would buy a canned version, maybe!

Next stop, the library!

![Los Altos library](/images/blog_september/los_altos_library.jpg)

It's kind of hidden away, isn't it? Kind of a contrast to the taller, more regal building that is the Mountain View library.

I took a walk around the building and discovered some nice trees. This one was large and beautiful. I can't quite remember, but I think it was a valley oak tree?

![Los Altos tree 1](/images/blog_september/los_altos_tree1.jpg)

I also found this sign pointing to Los Altos's sister cities:

Finally, we had dinner at Cafe Nur, a mediterranean restaurant. We both got the same thing: Lamb and beef doner plate!

![Cafe Nur](/images/blog_september/cafe_nur.jpg)

It was great, though it still doesn't match (the now out-of-business) Athineon in Berkeley. I still have never managed to find doner that matches the softness of the doner at Athineon.

We got free tea at Cafe Nur though!! Do you think I will be able to give away free tea at Koala Tea?

## Tiramisu 2

Today I made tiramisu again! It was so good last time that I just had to make it at least once more!

Here I am layering it...

![Tiramisu layer](/images/blog_september/tiramisu_layer.jpg)

Done!

![Tiramisu extra](/images/blog_september/tiramisu_extra.jpg)

Me: Huh? There's someone extra on top! What are you doing here?

Extra thing: I'm here to help keep the plastic wrap from touching the cream! That's useful, right?

Me: Uhh, I guess that's useful??
