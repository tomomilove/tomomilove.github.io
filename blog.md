## Inspiring quote

You know I have an extension for my web browser that shows me a random quote every day. Anyway, I saw this one and I thought it really captured how I feel about you! So I wanted to share it:

“I’m in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you.” -- John Green, _The Fault in Our Stars_
