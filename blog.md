## Cuphead

I just got this new game called _Cuphead_.

![Cuphead 1](/images/blog_april/cuphead1.jpg)

This is a game where you play as a cup person and fight against a series of bosses. The game tries really hard to look like an old fashioned cartoon, like the original Mickey Mouse. It's a pretty cool look, though also a little unsettling at times.

The game is pretty much only about fighting bosses. It's famous for being really difficult, but that's part of why I find it fun. I have to fight these bosses like a dozen times in order to beat them, but it's satisfying figuring out the right strategies to use and then being able to execute them effectively.

## Georgian soda

I went back to the Georgian food truck at Milk Pail, and decided to try one of their soft drinks.

![Tarragon soda 1](/images/blog_april/tarragon_soda1.jpg)

Can you read the flavor on the bottle? It's tarragon flavor, actually. I'm not sure if you're familar with tarragon, but it's an herb. Like, the kind of thing I've had in a chicken sandwich. Kind of an odd flavor for a soda, and it really did taste quite herby. But actually, I thought it was super good! A unique flavor I liked a lot! I think I'll get it again.

By the way, it also had a bit of a weird cap:

![Tarragon soda 2](/images/blog_april/tarragon_soda2.jpg)

It's neither a twist cap nor a pop bottle cap like you'd find in America. Instead, it's got this tab you pull up on to get the cap off.

It's so interesting seeing the norms of other countries like this! This cap is probably normal over there. And according to Wikipedia, Tarragon soda is pretty popular over there as well.

## 風物詩

Your mom gave me a book called 日本風物詩! I didn't know what the word 風物詩 mean, and you said it was something that reminds you of a certain time. I looked up the definition online, and that was spot on!

So I thought about, what are the 風物詩 in my life? What are things that remind me of different seasons?

#### Spring
- Walking around the neighborhood and looking at flowers!

#### Summer
- Mango smoothies
- My sun hat
- Trips to the ocean
- Crowded buses due to interns!

#### Fall
- Hot chocolate sold at Trader Joe's

#### Winter
- Lights wrapped around trees downtown
- My space heater

That's what I can think of for now! It was kind of difficult, maybe my habits don't vary much by season? What would your 風物詩 be, Tomomi?

## Chapter 37

Last time, Alice and co. defeated the red-haired bear king! Find out what happens next in chapter 37 [here](/story#３７章). English version [here](/english_story#chapter-37).

Sorry, this is a long chapter, but there wasn't a good way to break it up. This chapter marks the end of the first major arc of the story, so please enjoy!

## 百人一首

I read through (in English) the book of poems your mother gave me! I wasn't expecting this, but nearly all of the poems were about lost love, or longing for love. I guess that's what the style of the poem is about? Anyway, a lot of them were super depressing, but I recorded some of my favorites for you (generally on the more positive side):

Just as the Minano River<br>
surges from the peak<br>
of Mount Tsukuba,<br>
so my love cascades<br>
to make deep pools.

筑波嶺の峯より落つるみなの川恋ぞつもりて淵となりける

As the human heart's so fickle<br>
your feelings may have changed,<br>
but at least in my old home<br>
the plum blossoms bloom as always<br>
with a fragrance of the past.

人はいさ心も知らずぶるさとは花ぞ昔の香ににほひける

I thought I would give up my life<br>
to hold you in my arms,<br>
but after a night together,<br>
I find myself wishing<br>
that I could live forever.

君がため惜しからざりし命さへ長くもがなと思ひけるかな

Since I now recall fondly<br>
the painful days of the past,<br>
if I live long, I may look back<br>
on these harsh days, too,<br>
and find them sweet and good.

ながらへばまたこのごろやしのばれむ憂しとみし世ぞ今は恋しき

## Birthday celebration day!

Finally I've caught up to you in age!

You did a really nice job celebrating my birthday this year! You made me this cake!

![Birthday cake](/images/blog_april/birthday_cake.jpg)

It was so smooth, round, and delicious!

Then you took me to sushi! We also saw flowers:

![Kaitenzushi](/images/blog_april/kaitenzushi.gif)
![Sakura](/images/blog_april/sakura.gif)

I liked nanuuku sushi! But what is it? I looked it up on Google and didn't find anything.

After that we went stargazing, and had more cake in the car! Unfortunately this was not a good time for photos...

## First burn

Each time you answer correctly on a WaniKani item during review, a greater time passes before you have to review it again. The item goes through stages: apprentice, guru, master, enlightened, burn. Once an item hits burn, it never appears again!

The time between the review from enlightened to burned is 6 months. I just burned my first items today! (Check this blog, the first mention of WaniKani is in October, about 6 months ago!)

![Burned](/images/blog_april/burned.png)

I'm also coming up on the 1 year anniversary of me studying Japanese (it's in April). I didn't realize I had started learning kanji almost exactly 6 months in.

## Parents' present

I received a birthday present from my parents today! It's a charging stand for my phone:

![Phone stand 2](/images/blog_april/phone_stand2.jpg)
![Phone stand 1](/images/blog_april/phone_stand1.jpg)

(By the way, these photos were taken in the same lighting, but one with my old phone and one with my new phone. You can really tell the difference in image quality, huh...)

I was wondering if such a thing would be all that helpful, but I guess it'll make it easier to pick up my phone from the ground in the morning! It also has a neat feature to prevent notifications when the phone is on it, so they don't annoy you while sleeping. Also, it's just neat!

I think it could be cool if contact charging devices were built into various public places. Imagine if you were sitting at a table at the library or a cafe for example, and you just put your laptop or phone on the table and it automatically charges. You wouldn't have to mess with cords, or even carry your own charger!

## Chapter 35

Two chapters in a row! Chapter 35 is [available here](/story#３５章). English version [here](/english_story#chapter-35).

# 8 April
## Chapter 34

Last time, Alice and co. ventured into the forest on a mission to hunt the red-haired bear king, a fearsome beast that had killed many adventurers from Maginia. As they were traveling through the forest, it jumped out at them in surprise, launching them into a fight. See what happens next in chapter 34, [available here](/story#３４章). English version [here](/english_story#chapter-34).

## Work on the weekend

I took Friday off, but it was a bit wasted because I had to do a little bit of work today anyway. I signed up to do design reviews for the residency program I was in when I first started working. I am assigned a group that's going through that program, and I am supposed to look at the design document for their project, and provide them with suggestions and feedback. They sent me their draft document on Friday, and I have to go over it with them on Monday, so I had to look at it sometime this weekend.

It wasn't too bad though. I walked to the library, sat there, and looked through it. The library is so nice it didn't even feel like work. Plus I got my vitamin D from walking!

## Down vs fake down

I was searching online today to find a new down jacket, since my current one is pretty beaten up. I had to put another piece of tape on it, so I guess it's done...

Anyway, while looking for jackets online I came across some made from synthetic down rather than real down. I decided to look up the differences.

Apparently, one major benefit of synthetic down is that it holds heat well when wet. Another benefit is that it weighs less than real down, and breathes better.

The one major con is that they haven't been able to make synthetic down that is as warm as real down yet. It seems like the best synthetic down would only be as warm as real down with around 550 down rating. However, my current down jacket has a rating of 750. I thought that was a good amount, so I don't think I can get a synthetic down jacket.

Hopefully the technology improves in the future and synthetic down becomes as good as real down!

## robots.txt

It occurred to me I should add a _robots.txt_ file to this site. This is a special file you can add to your site that explains to search engines how to crawl your site.

You can check out the one I added by visiting [tomomilove.com/robots.txt](/robots.txt). The one I added is pretty simple. It requests all search engines to not record anything in this site. This means, for instance, tomomilove.com will never appear in Google search results.

It's possible to add more complicated instructions to a robots.txt file. You could specify that search engines are allowed to record certain pages, but not others. You could also include a _site map_, which would direct search engines to all the pages on your site. In our case though, I see no reason for the site to be publicly searchable.

## Origami wolf

I found this origami wolf in a conference room at work! It's made from a post-it note.

![Origami wolf 1](/images/blog_april/origami_wolf1.jpg)

I wonder who made it, and how. Maybe they folded it while bored during a meeting, but does that mean they had the design memorized? I don't think they'd be able to follow diagrams while in a meeting. I'm impressed if they had it memorized!

Anyway, I thought it was a cute design, so I looked up the instructions and made it myself!

![Origami wolf 2](/images/blog_april/origami_wolf2.jpg)

Mine didn't come out so well, though... But it was fun trying!

## WaniKani mods

One nice things about WaniKani is that it's built in such a way that users can easily create and share modifications for it. I recently got some and tried them out.

Here's what I tried:

- __Dark theme modification__:
![WaniKani mods](/images/blog_april/wanikani_mods.png)

- __Ignore answer button__: If you get an answer wrong during reviews, this lets you mark it correct instead. Useful if you just made a typo!

- __Hide English sentences__: When learning vocab, there are example sentences in Japanese with English translations. This mod hides the English sentences until you hover over them, giving you a chance to try to read the Japanese first.

- __Delay on incorrect answer__: Sometimes if you get an answer wrong, you accidentally press the enter key quickly without thinking about it, and go on to the next question without getting a chance to read why you got the answer wrong. This mod prevents you from going to the next question for 2 seconds after inputting a wrong answer, fixing that issue.

There were some other interesting mods I didn't try! One example was a font randomizer, that makes the kanji display using different fonts at random, giving you an opportunity to practice reading different styles.

## Getting outside

I've been trying to think of way I can get outside more, to help with my vitamin D deficiency.

There's not too much place to walk around my work, but we do have a rooftop patio area. I decided to go take a look.

![Rooftop patio 1](/images/blog_april/rooftop_patio1.jpg)
![Rooftop patio 2](/images/blog_april/rooftop_patio2.jpg)
![Rooftop patio 3](/images/blog_april/rooftop_patio3.jpg)

It's pretty nice! There's even a kitchen out here!

![Rooftop kitchen](/images/blog_april/rooftop_kitchen.jpg)

There's also these bocce ball courts that no one uses. You can tell because they're covered in weeds...

![Rooftop bocce](/images/blog_april/rooftop_bocce.jpg)

Actually, this whole area is typically pretty empty. Maybe more people will be here during the summer? For now though, it's a nice quiet place.

# 1 April
## Pills

So I went ahead and bought these vitamin D supplement pills.

![Vitamin D pills](/images/blog_april/vitamin_d.jpg)

I think I said this before, but it feels a bit embarrassing. Like I'm admitting that I'm not eating well enough, or getting outside enough, so I have to take these pills. But embarrassing or not, that's the reality of the situation. If these pills are good for me, I'll take them.

Actually, I've been having these for a couple of days now, and already I feel a bit healthier than before. I don't know -- I guess that's very likely to be placebo. But who knows, maybe vitamin imbalance really was contributing to me feeling unhealthy! That sort of thing really does affect people's state of mind.

## Penitencia Creek Park

Today we took a trip to Penitencia Creek Park. Who knew such a nice spot of green was in the middle of San Jose!

![Penitencia park 1](/images/blog_march/penitencia1.jpg)

There was a really nice creek as well.

![Penitencia park 2](/images/blog_march/penitencia2.jpg)

We saw some funny squirrels there! They ran around the ground, hid in holes, and liked to stand up straight. One of them was talking for a while, and the others would just stand and listen. I wonder what they were communicating?

I really liked this park and I want to go back!
