## Food truck mania!
So I discovered that a food trucks comes to Milk Pail every Wednesday. I wasn't able to make it the past two weeks, but I made sure to try it out this week!

The first thing I noticed is that this food truck ("The Meating Spot") is not the one that was here the previous week. That one was a Mexican food truck. I was really looking forward to trying that one, but I decided to give this one a shot anyway.

It was some kind of vaguely Asian themed food.

To be honest, it wasn't very good! Overall, it was just very basic. Some rice, some kimchi, and some chicken with sauce over lettuce. And the rice was pretty hard and not tasty. It's too bad this one is no good. I hope the Mexican truck is back next week and that I'll get to try that one.

I did realize one thing though: I sure am eating at a lot of food trucks lately! There is this one, and the other one by Target, and also I like to go to the food trucks at work for lunch! Maybe I should give it a rest!

## Mega Man 11

One of the first games I ever played was Mega Man 2.

This is a genre of game known as platformer. Essentially, your goal is to run, jump, and shoot your way to the end of the level.

I first played Mega Man 2 around 20 years ago, and even at the time, the game was old. The game was originally released in 1988.

Anyway, the series is still going, and today they released Mega Man 11, which I decided to buy.

The graphics have improved a little bit, but otherwise, it's very much the same type of game it was 30 years ago. I guess that's a part of the charm, though.

## One-Pan Coconut Chicken Curry _with Sweet Potatoes and Bok Choy_
Here's a new Blue Apron recipe I made.

![Coconut curry chicken](/images/blog_october/coconut_curry_chicken.jpg)

It was supposed to be curry... but all the liquid of the curry disappeared. I think it was a combination of me accidentally boiling it away and the sweet potatoes absorbing the rest.

As for the recipe, it was all right. Sweet potatoes are always good, and they go decently with the curry flavor. As for the bok choy, it felt like it was barely there. It shrunk a lot during cooking and I didn't really notice it while eating. At least it's healthy, though?

The chicken I overcooked slightly, but it wasn't bad!
