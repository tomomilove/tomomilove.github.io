## Humanoid crane

I still receive emails about meetings for our old origami club. About a month ago, I received one that said they were going to make a humanoid crane. I had always wanted to build this model actually, but never thought I could find the diagrams. However, the email mentioned the original artist's name, Sasade Shinji, so I decided to go look for them.

I was able to find some low quality ones online! So I went to fold the humanoid crane! Here is what it is supposed to look like (photo not mine):

And here's mine:

It turned out all right! My only regret was not using larger paper. It was a fun build though!

## Performance rating

I received my semi-annual performance rating today. The rating I got was "exceeds expectations". Contrary to its name, this is actual the normal expected rating, because everyone is expected to exceed their role.

This is better than I had done the past two times though, so I guess it's a personal improvement. I still feel infinitely far away from a promotion though, unfortunately.

I think my primary feedback was that I need to deliver more impactful results. Ah, it's so difficult...
