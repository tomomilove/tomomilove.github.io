## Momo Grill

Yesterday I went to the new Momo Grill food truck to ask them if they had chai, and they still didn't have it. So I asked them when they would have it, and they said to come back tomorrow around 7pm.

So I came back today. But they still didn't have the chai. Oh well. I decided to order food there anyway.

They had momo (which are like dumplings), fried rice, and chow mein. I think the food is supposed to be from a region of India that is near China and influenced by it.

I got the chicken momo. They tasted like pretty normal dumplings too me. Where it got crazy was the sauce. They had "momo sauce" and also a curry sauce. Both were pretty good, but extremely spicy. The momo sauce may have been the spiciest thing I've had in years. I was dieing!

## Vitamin D deficiency

I received the results from my blood tests yesterday, and one result was that I have low levels of vitamin D. It feels bad to learn something like that. Once I read it, I suddenly felt worse.

Recommendations from the doctor are to get more sunlight exposure (without sunscreen), eat more dairy products, and also take a vitamin D pill every day.

I can try to get more sunlight and drink some milk every day, but my gut reaction is that I don't want to take a pill. Shouldn't I be able to get enough naturally? But maybe this is the consequence of working an indoors job.

I suppose I should go look for a vitamin D pill. Who knows, maybe it will make me feel more healthy in my daily life?

## Lab tests

Back when I went to see my doctor, she told me to get lab tests done. I had been putting it off until now, but I finally got it done. The difficult part is that you need to have not eaten anything for the past 10 hours. So pretty much the only time you can get it done is in the morning, before breakfast.

The test involves drawing blood and running analysis on it. I'm not really afraid of needle or drawing blood at all. However, the person doing the test on me kept asking me if I was afraid and okay, and that actually made me feel worried. In any case, I didn't look when the person poked me and drew blood.

The person who drew my blood commented that I have thin veins. I'm not sure what that means -- hopefully it's not a bad thing!

## Kowagarijanai Chronicles chapter 33

Previously, Alice and co. were traveling through the forest when they came to a door guarded by a soldier from Maginia. They were told they couldn't go through, because beyond it was the territory of the red-haired bear king, a fearsome monster that had killed many adventurers from Maginia. However, after conferring with Princess Persephone, Kowagarijanai guild was given permission to enter and help hunt the bear king.

## Bulb garden

Today you took me to visit a garden of bulbs. I really liked it!

![Bulb garden 3](/images/blog_march/bulb_garden3.jpg)

I really like these shots just filled with flowers!

This garden was in someone's private home that they kindly opened up to the public. It has inspired me -- if I ever get a house, I want to grow a magnificent garden!

I wonder how much work it is? Looking at these photos, there are so many flowers... and all of them cared for by hand. It's crazy to think one person is responsible for so much life.

## Daijoubu the owl

I made this owl for you with leftover wool from when I made your assistant.

![Daijoubu the owl](/images/blog_march/daijoubu_the_owl.jpg)

Daijoubu the owl is here to tell you everything is going to be all right! No matter what happens, your owl friend is here for you!

## Kolkhida

I tried this Georgian Street Food truck that came to Milk Pail.

![Kolkhida truck](/images/blog_march/kolkhida_truck.jpg)

The truck was completely operated by one person. He seemed to be the owner, and pretty passionate. He talked to the people in front of me in line for like 10 minutes because I guess they were from an area near Georgia? He talked about his struggles to get certain kinds of ingredients in the US, some kinds of Georgian cultural events he goes to, and his aspirations to open a restaurant one day.

I tried the food! Got some lamb, fries, and a spinach thing that I can't remember the name of.

![Kolkhida food](/images/blog_march/kolkhida_food.jpg)

It was pretty good. I'll say the lamb and the fires were a bit too salty for my tastes, and the spinach was very much not salty at all. I may go back sometime, though I wonder what location he will go to after Milk Pail closes.

## Cookie days

For the past 3 days, someone at work has been leaving out boxes of huge, delicious cookies and doughnuts.

![Cookie](/images/blog_march/cookie.jpg)

They're huge, soft, and delicious. Probably not the kind of cookies you would like, but I love them!

I think there have been a group of people going through a series of important meetings at work. So they order cookies for themselves and then leave out the leftovers, when they're done.

I feel bad about eating the cookies because they must be filled with sugar. And my doctor told me to eat less sugar! But they are so good...

## Haiku

I read [an article](https://www.tofugu.com/japan/haiku/) on Tofugu about haiku and decided to try writing one. Here I go!

大海の岸では隠し子鼠か

Do you remember when we went to that park by Alviso by the way, and saw the sign with the cute mouse on it? We kind of looked for it in the grass, but didn't see one... It would be nearly impossible to find one, I guess. I wrote this haiku imagining that we had actually spotted one, hiding among the grass!

Writing this haiku was pretty difficult. It's hard to convey rich imagery with only 17 mora. I had to leave a lot up to implication, like the fact that the mouse would be hiding amongst leaves of grass.

## Remembering Milk Pail

Today I learned the sad news that Milk Pail is closing soon. No specific date was given, but I would guess within the year.

It's a real shame. There were all sorts of unique things you could get at Milk Pail that you couldn't get anywhere else. Here's what I remember...

- Really good cheeses!
- Ravioli made with the cheeses!
- Turkish delights
- Frozen croissants
- Lady fingers (for tiramisu!)
- Mango lassi
- Small amounts of argula, spinach, and other vegetables

And, maybe it sounds too sentimental, but I really have fond memories of going there with you.

I'm really going to miss Milk Pail.

## Final Fantasy 9

I recently got a new game to play, _Final Fantasy 9_. This is a pretty old game, originally released 19 years ago, just now re-released on Switch.

This game has a pretty interesting history. It wasn't popular when it first released, probably because of its kind of silly and whimsical look. At the time, it was viewed as a big departure from the much more popular Final Fantasy 7, which had an edgier and cooler style. However, over time, 9's reputation has grown a lot.

I've only played a short ways into Final Fantasy 9 so far, but right now I'm really impressed with the game's story. The characters are all so detailed, even the minor ones. And the world feels so rich and filled with stories. I'm not sure who the writer for this game was, but whoever they were, they clearly loved writing lots and lots of stories. 

Here are some screenshots I took while playing the game. It uses an old graphical technique called "prerendered backgrounds". You can run around the world like it's 3D, but the environments are really just drawings. It's a cool look, you can see it lets them get pretty artsy with perspective and framing.

## Night walk

We took a nice walk to downtown and back today. I know it was flat, but I hope it wasn't too boring for you!

I really enjoy walking out at night, provided that the area doesn't feel dangerous and I'm not alone. I've liked being out in the night for as long as I can remember -- I remember when I was a kid, Halloween was always my favorite holiday because you got to walk around outside in the dark.

I'm not sure why I like. It's just so beautiful, I guess. I like looking into the houses with lights on inside -- they seem so cozy. Also the stars are out!

## More puzzles!

I didn't have much to do today, so I walked to the library and worked on the puzzle!

Here's the progress when I started:

![Puzzle before](/images/blog_march/puzzle_before.jpg)

And here's how far I got by the end:

![Puzzle after](/images/blog_march/puzzle_after.jpg)

Actually, it wasn't just me working on the puzzle! While I was working, some random person came and helped out for a bit. She was really fast at it, and did most of the sky area that I had been ignoring. I asked her how she was so good, she said she didn't really know, she just does it! Maybe it comes with practice.

## The life of a plumber

Today I got our kitchen sink faucet replaced!

![New faucet](/images/blog_march/new_faucet.jpg)

I had requested for it to be repaired, but the repiar person just brought a new faucet. I guess that works!

While he was repairing the faucet, the repair person was telling me about his life. It was pretty interesting actually. After I told him I grew up in Davis, he told me that he owns farm landdown there. He doesn't work the farm himself, but he pays people to do it. He also owns a 100 year old Victorian home on that farmland, which he renovated himself. This was surprising to me because I didn't think people owned farmland and then spent their day job as a plumber.

He also told me about other jobs he had. He used to work in the kitchen of a hospital. And he slowly rose through the ranks from dishwasher to the head chef. He said he worked that job for about 20 years, liked it, but then decided to do something different simply for the sake of something different. After that he went into gardening. Then he went back to school, studied gas and electric work, and from there got into repair jobs. He said he used to do repair jobs for a trailer park, but now he does them for my landlord. He says he finds plumbing to be fun.

If you ask me, it sounds like a pretty rich life. I like the idea of doing a bunch of different jobs. I think I don't want to do one job forever.

## Staying home day

I stayed home today to get our kitchen faucet repaired.

![Old faucet](/images/blog_march/old_faucet.jpg)

For a few days now it has been leaking constantly. I shouldn't have waited so long to get it repaired, since it's a lot of water wasted. But it's tough because I have to stay home from work to let the repair person in.

Today turned out to be a good day to stay home though, because I was a little sick.

Anyway, the repair person came... and then quickly realized he didn't have the right equipment, and told me he would have to come back tomorrow. So that's kind of a waste of a day off. However, he was very nice and told me he could come tomorrow after I got off work.

## Daylight savings

Thanks for telling me about daylight savings yesterday! Otherwise I don't think I would have noticed yesterday.

I would definitely have noticed today though! It was sunny as I went home from work. And there weren't even any clouds. It's such a simple thing, but it really does make me happier!

If it were up to me, we'd have daylight savings time year-round. The only arguments I've heard against it is that it would be dark in the morning when going to work, but that's only if you go to work as early as 7am. I get into work later, so daylight savings would be better for me in any case!

# 10 March
## Chapter 30

## Downtown day

My friend came to visit today! He said he wanted to try dim sum, so we went to the one downtown.

![Dim sum](/images/blog_march/dim_sum.jpg)

This place was pretty nice! It was a bit cleaner and fancier than I am used to from dim sum places. A little more expensive, too. I enjoyed the food quite a bit, but then again, I always like dim sum!

Afterwards, we went to the library to work on the puzzle a little bit. We made some progress!

![Puzzle progress](/images/blog_march/puzzle_progress.jpg)

Here's what the final picture would have looked like:

![Puzzle picture](/images/blog_march/puzzle_picture.jpg)

As you can see, it's a big but easy puzzle. It has lots of small details and distinct areas, making it quick to tell where any piece belongs! It also has a lot of words in it, which allows you to easily figure out the orientation of pieces.

I wan to go back and finish this puzzle sometime! I wonder if it'll still be there...

# 8 March
## Party day

Today was kind of a party day at work. My team manager planned a special lunch for us with catering, for no real reason. It was tacos, just like Mamacitas (but not quite as good). We even got churros and horchata!

![Tacos](/images/blog_march/tacos.jpg)

After that, we had a fun event. An instructor came and we built robots in teams and then battled them.

![Robot 1](/images/blog_march/robot1.jpg)

Here they are battling... The goal is to pop the other's balloon with a needle on your arm!
![Robots](/images/blog_march/robots.gif)

All in all, it was a pretty fun event!

## Losing things

It's been a bad year for losing things. First it was my wireless earbuds, then my hat, then my cup and teapot...

Another thing I have been slowly losing over time is the rubber tips that go on my earbuds. So far, whenever I have lost one, I have been able to replace it with tips taken from my old earbuds. However, I eventually ran out of those...

Then I remembered, when I bought my earbuds long ago, it came with this huge array of earbud tips!

![Earbud array](/images/blog_march/earbud_array.jpg)

I think it's funny to see them all lined up like this!

## Email authentication

When you send an email to someone, it's possible to write whatever you want in the sender address.

This poses a problem: When you receive an email, how can you tell that it's actually from who it says it's from?

Today, most email service providers implement some form of _authentication_, a method for determining whether the email sender is who they actually claim to be. I'll describe one such method, which is known as _SPF_ (Sender Policy Framework).

Imagine a scenario where alice@hotmail.com sends an email to tanaka@gmail.com. In this process, a computer owned by hotmail.com (Microsoft) communicates with a computer owned by gmail.com (Google).

When Google receives this message, it sees that the from address claims to be alice@hotmail.com. In order to check whether this is true, it must determine whether the computer it is communicating with is actually owned by Microsoft. If it is actually Microsoft, then Google will trust Microsoft that the message is really sent by alice.

So, how can Google know for sure whether the computer is actually owned by Microsoft?

There is only one piece of information that Google knows for sure about the computer it is communicating with, and that is its _IP address_. An IP address describes the geographical location of a computer in the real world. Google must know the IP address of the computer because it is exchanging messages with it, and Google has to know where in the real world to send the messages.

Since Google knows the IP address, all it needs to check is whether this IP address is owned by Microsoft or not.

In order to do that, Google does a _DNS lookup_ on "hotmail.com". The DNS (Domain Name System) is a globally available database of information about internet domains. Domain owners can register their domain here along with various information about the domain. In particular, Microsoft has registered an entry for "hotmail.com", and in that entry, they've included a list of IP addresses they own. All Google needs to do is check whether the IP address of the computer they are communicating with is in that list. This allows them to conclude the computer is owned by Microsoft.

And that is how the email authentication method known as SPF works.

## Double mentorship

Earlier I mentioned I was assigned to mentor a new engineer on the team. I have begun by giving a series of small talks going over our team's major systems.

Then, another new engineer on our team joined days later. I invited them to join my talks, so now I am teaching the two of them.

I enjoy it a lot. It reminds me of my days at school, lecturing. Except it's much nicer to teach such a small number of people. It reminds me, I used to want to be a teacher. Maybe someday...

## Council from friends

I had lunch with two of my old friends from college that work at the same company as me. They seem to be doing well. One of them, who hated their team for the longest time, transferred to another team and now likes it a lot. They now work on self-driving cars, at the building near where I live.

At lunch, they spent a long time trying to comfort and encourage me, because now the one who has been doing the worst at work. I've been here the longest, but I still haven't been promoted yet, or anything...

Struggling with promotion is something that increasingly weighs on my mind, as more time passes. It's hard to tell how much to blame myself, vs my team, vs my manager. Would I be better off switching teams? Or is it really up to me to try harder?

## Crazy cat show!

We saw some crazy cats at the cat show! It seems like they all take a certain characteristic to the extreme. They are either the most fluffy, or the most skinny. And they are quite large, and super well groomed.

As you said though, there potentially some troubling aspects to a cat show. The emphasis on pure breeds, or if the breeders are in it primarily to promote their cat's breed so they can sell it, or if the breeders have to drug their cats to get them to behave... Who really knows what goes on, but it wouldn't surprise me if competition brings out some shady things. 

Anyway, I wonder what the cats think of it all. I hope it's not too stressful for them, and it's a happy life!

## Next story chapter
