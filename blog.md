## Work on the weekend

I took Friday off, but it was a bit wasted because I had to do a little bit of work today anyway. I signed up to do design reviews for the residency program I was in when I first started working. I am assigned a group that's going through that program, and I am supposed to look at the design document for their project, and provide them with suggestions and feedback. They sent me their draft document on Friday, and I have to go over it with them on Monday, so I had to look at it sometime this weekend.

It wasn't too bad though. I walked to the library, sat there, and looked through it. The library is so nice it didn't even feel like work. Plus I got my vitamin D from walking!

## Down vs fake down

I was searching online today to find a new down jacket, since my current one is pretty beaten up. I had to put another piece of tape on it, so I guess it's done...

Anyway, while looking for jackets online I came across some made from synthetic down rather than real down. I decided to look up the differences.

Apparently, one major benefit of synthetic down is that it holds heat well when wet. Another benefit is that it weighs less than real down, and breathes better.

The one major con is that they haven't been able to make synthetic down that is as warm as real down yet. It seems like the best synthetic down would only be as warm as real down with around 550 down rating. However, my current down jacket has a rating of 750. I thought that was a good amount, so I don't think I can get a synthetic down jacket.

Hopefully the technology improves in the future and synthetic down becomes as good as real down!

## robots.txt

It occurred to me I should add a _robots.txt_ file to this site. This is a special file you can add to your site that explains to search engines how to crawl your site.

You can check out the one I added by visiting [tomomilove.com/robots.txt](/robots.txt). The one I added is pretty simple. It requests all search engines to not record anything in this site. This means, for instance, tomomilove.com will never appear in Google search results.

It's possible to add more complicated instructions to a robots.txt file. You could specify that search engines are allowed to record certain pages, but not others. You could also include a _site map_, which would direct search engines to all the pages on your site. In our case though, I see no reason for the site to be publicly searchable.

## Origami wolf

I found this origami wolf in a conference room at work! It's made from a post-it note.

I wonder who made it, and how. Maybe they folded it while bored during a meeting, but does that mean they had the design memorized? I don't think they'd be able to follow diagrams while in a meeting. I'm impressed if they had it memorized!

Anyway, I thought it was a cute design, so I looked up the instructions and made it myself!

Mine didn't come out so well, though... But it was fun trying!

## WaniKani mods

One nice things about WaniKani is that it's built in such a way that users can easily create and share modifications for it. I recently got some and tried them out.

Here's what I tried:

- __Dark theme modification__:
![WaniKani mods](/images/blog_april/wanikani_mods.png)

- __Ignore answer button__: If you get an answer wrong during reviews, this lets you mark it correct instead. Useful if you just made a typo!

- __Hide English sentences__: When learning vocab, there are example sentences in Japanese with English translations. This mod hides the English sentences until you hover over them, giving you a chance to try to read the Japanese first.

- __Delay on incorrect answer__: Sometimes if you get an answer wrong, you accidentally press the enter key quickly without thinking about it, and go on to the next question without getting a chance to read why you got the answer wrong. This mod prevents you from going to the next question for 2 seconds after inputting a wrong answer, fixing that issue.

There were some other interesting mods I didn't try! One example was a font randomizer, that makes the kanji display using different fonts at random, giving you an opportunity to practice reading different styles.

## Getting outside

I've been trying to think of way I can get outside more, to help with my vitamin D deficiency.

There's not too much place to walk around my work, but we do have a rooftop patio area. I decided to go take a look.

It's pretty nice! There's even a kitchen out here!

There's also these bocce ball courts that no one uses. You can tell because they're covered in weeds...

Actually, this whole area is typically pretty empty. Maybe more people will be here during the summer? For now though, it's a nice quiet place.

## Pills

So I went ahead and bought these vitamin D supplement pills.

I think I said this before, but it feels a bit embarrassing. Like I'm admitting that I'm not eating well enough, or getting outside enough, so I have to take these pills. But embarrassing or not, that's the reality of the situation. If these pills are good for me, I'll take them.

Actually, I've been having these for a couple of days now, and already I feel a bit healthier than before. I don't know -- I guess that's very likely to be placebo. But who knows, maybe vitamin imbalance really was contributing to me feeling unhealthy! That sort of thing really does affect people's state of mind.

## Penitencia Creek Park

Today we took a trip to Penitencia Creek Park. Who knew such a nice spot of green was in the middle of San Jose!

![Penitencia park 1](/images/blog_march/penitencia1.jpg)

There was a really nice creek as well.

![Penitencia park 2](/images/blog_march/penitencia2.jpg)

We saw some funny squirrels there! They ran around the ground, hid in holes, and liked to stand up straight. One of them was talking for a while, and the others would just stand and listen. I wonder what they were communicating?

I really liked this park and I want to go back!
