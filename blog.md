## Concert!

Today we watched someone perform music! Thank you for taking me! I have wanted to hear this person for a long time!

It's been ages since I went to a concert like this. I remember being exceedingly bored when going to my sister's performances when she was in middle school. I think it's a case of not understanding what's going on, so it's hard to appreciate.

I still don't understand anything about music. At today's performance, from what people said, I understood that certain difficult and technical things were happening, but I couldn't pick up on it at all myself. I also don't understand anything about how the different pieces of a song go together. One part kind of suddenly ends and the next part begins and it sounds totally different, and I'm not sure why they're a part of the same song.

Despite not understanding, I do enjoy it, now that I'm older. I think one thing that's changed in me when growing up is becoming generally more receptive, better able to appreciate a wide variety of experiences.

By the way, the place we visited where the performance took place was quite beautiful. Here's a photo I took!

## Next story chapter

Last time, Alice went off to Napier's store to buy adventuring supplies, leaving the other members of Kowagarijanai guild with the day off. Let's see what Tanaka Rin and Yamamoto Emika are up to during this time. This chapter isn't written from Alice's perspective.

## Reading vs. writing

Recently I've come to appreciate just how different the skills of reading and writing are.

I heard of criticism of WaniKani that it sometimes teaches uncommon words. So if you learn a word in WaniKani, then go and use it yourself, you may end up sounding silly.

However, the key thing to realize is that the goal of WaniKani is only to teach you how to read, not to teach you how to produce language yourself. When WaniKani teaches you a word, it does not mean to suggest that you should use that word. It is merely teaching you how to read it should you ever happen to come across it. WaniKani is good at what it does, but its scope is very limited.

So how do you learn the skill of producing language? I think it is much more difficult than reading.

When I think about this stuff, I realize how far away I am from really learning the language. But I can only take it one step at a time.

## Bunpro

My kanji skills are improving a lot, but my grammar skills not very much so. 

I heard about a website called Bunpro for grammar study. It's kind of similar to WaniKani in that it gives you a series of reviews at spaced time intervals.

I tried it out and it was all right. The way it works is they show you a sentence with a blank in it, and you have to type it in. Here's an example:

![Bunpro](/images/blog_january/bunpro.png)

It seems like it's useful for helping you to remember some details of the different grammar points. However, it doesn't really help you understand or construct more complex sentences, which is where I primarily struggle I think.

I don't think I'm going to spend too much time doing Bunpro, for now. I'm just going to continue to focus on WaniKani, which already takes up a lot of my time.

## End of year stats

I received a report on my credit card spending for this year. I compared it to the report from last year, and here's what I've found:

- Overall, expenses were up.
- My expenses were broken into four major categories: "merchandise" (includes food), "entertainment", "travel", "services". Merchandise and entertainment are about even, and make up the bulk of spending. Travel and services are smaller.
- Entertainment spending went down, but merchandise spending went up. I wish I knew why. They don't give you a more detailed break down.
- Here's a chart of spending over the months. ![Spending chart](/images/blog_january/spending_chart.png) Kind of a weird trend. Why'd I spend so much in February? Why so much in November? Why not so much in October?

Anyway, I don't think I met my goal to spend less money on food this past year. I'll keep trying!

## Next chapter

Chapter 25 of the story is available [here](/story#２５章). English version is [here](/english_story#chapter-25).

It's been a while since the last chapter, sorry if it's hard to follow because of that!

## 元

Hey, I know that character! It's "gen", or "moto", which I learned means "origin". The mnemonic for this one is interesting... it's composed of the radical "two" (二) and the radical "legs". What is your origin? Where did you come from? Well, you came from between two legs...

Anyway, today we went to a new Korean BBQ place near where I lived called Gen! Given that character though, is it really Korean I wonder?

No matter, we ate well!

![Gen 1](/images/blog_january/gen1.jpg)
![Gen 2](/images/blog_january/gen2.jpg)

One thing about Gen I was epecially impressed by was how comfortable it felt there. There was a lot of space, cool blue lighting, and a lot of ventillation. Compared to the one other Korean BBQ place I've been, which was dark, smoky, cramped, crowded, and had a lot of red decor. I think when you combine all that with the fact that you're cooking at your table, it's a bit uncomfortable! You feel like you're being cooked yourself!

## The past and the future

Recently, I've been trying to wrap my head around some of the past and future words in Japanese. For example, 先. I've seen it translated as "previous" and "some time ago", but also "the future" and "hereafter". It seems contradictory... but is it?

I'm trying to come up with the right visual metaphor to understand this word.

Imagine you're standing in line. The person in front of you goes before you, and when it's your turn they will be the previous person. In addition, they can be thought of as a future version of yourself. When it's their turn, they are doing what you will be doing in the future.

I guess that makes sense. Though it's still hard to reconcile words like 先月 with the meaning of future. It's clearly the past month, not the future month, right?

I think past/future words also work the same way in English. Imagine you are on a hiking trail. You look in front of you, and you say: "Look at the beautiful land that lies before me!" Then you turn around and look behind you and say: "Look at all the beautiful land I saw before!" It seems like "before" can be used to describe both the future and the present land.

The more I think about this, the more confused I get. Maybe I don't understand what "future" really means, in the first place...

## New phone wallpaper!

It's been so long, but I finally have a new wallpaper for my phone!

![Phone wallpaper](/images/blog_january/phone_wallpaper.png)

This is actually a photograph of a window of a conference room in my building. I thought it was really pretty, don't you?

## My wireless setup

I'm finally able to play my Switch without needing earbuds plugged into it!

First I had to buy this adapter, because the Switch can't use bluetooth earbuds by itself...

![Genki adapter](/images/blog_january/genki_adapter.jpg)

The brand is called "Genki". Hey, I know that word! I wonder why they chose that name though.

Then I got these headphones!

![Headphones](/images/blog_january/headphones.jpg)

These were the cheapest headphones I could find that met my requirements (these aren't those fancy $500 - $1000 headphones). My main requirement was low latency, because latency is noticeable when gaming, since the sound responds to your actions (unlike when listening to music).

I decided to get headphones over earbuds for a couple of reasons:

- Much longer battery life (40 hours vs 6 hours)
- Harder to lose
- Even cheap headphones are going to have better sound than expensive earbuds

## My Game of the Year award

The other day you saw the game *Hollow Knight* on my Switch home screen and asked me about it. I didn't give you much of an answer then, but I figured I'd write about it now, since it was probably my favorite game I played last year.

![Hollow Knight 1](/images/blog_january/hollow_knight1.jpg)
![Hollow Knight 2](/images/blog_january/hollow_knight2.jpg)
![Hollow Knight 3](/images/blog_january/hollow_knight3.jpg)

This is a game in the Metroidvania genre that has you exploring a vast insect civilization world. As you can tell from the screenshots, the game has a very distinct look to it. Kind of cute but also creepy and mysterious, just like real insects! And overall, quite beautiful.

What sets this game apart from its peers is that the world is so big and feels so rich. There's quite a lot of story to this world, lots of interesting and fun characters to meet, and lots of secrets to discover.

Surprisingly, Hollow Knight was made by a very tiny Australian indie studio with only 2 people + one musician + one technical director. I can't imagine creating such an impressive piece of software with only 4 people!

## Postcard from a friend

I received this postcard from our friends in Sacramento!

![Grand Canyon postcard](/images/blog_january/grand_canyon_postcard.jpg)

And I remembered to thank them for it over the internet!

They said the Grand Canyon was so majestic it didn't look real. Have you ever seen it? It sounds like a place I'd like to see sometime. However, I'm worried that the hikes people go on there would be too strenuous for me.

## Lunch interview

I was assigned to do a lunch interview at work today. You eat lunch with the candidate but you do not evaluate them. It is a chance for them to ask you questions about what it's like to work at the company.

I have set my preferences for no interviews, but a few weeks ago they assigned one to me anyway. I responded back declining the interview and saying I didn't want to do it, but they never responded to me. So I guess I had to do it.

I don't think I'm the best person for lunch interviews. My experience probably doesn't leave such a good impression on candidates. Today I got asked questions and had to admit that I haven't been promoted in 3 years, that my team is so small, that my manager is overworked, that I don't really make friends with my coworkers, and things like that...

I think, for my company's own good, they should not assign me to do lunch interviews!

## Finally chocolate

We finally drank the hot chocolate you gave me so long ago! I think you went to France back in April, so it's been like 8 months!

![Angelina chocolate 1](/images/blog_january/angelina_chocolate1.jpg)
![Angelina chocolate 2](/images/blog_january/angelina_chocolate2.jpg)

For a while I was confused as to how it could last so long. When we opened it up, I was surprised to discover it was completely solid!

We made it easily, and it seemed to retain all the quality and flavor I could expect! Imagine, I have been searching for good hot chocolate for so long, and it was right under my nose the whole time...

I'm starting to like your mother's idea to buy one dozen. We could have one for every week of winter!

## Doctor struggles

So today I finally tried to book a doctor's appointment.

I very quickly learned that all the doctors with good ratings are full and no longer accepting patients, while the only ones that are free either have bad ratings or very few or none.

I managed to book an appointment with a doctor that I was able to find a single good rating for. I guess that's better than nothing? There was only one time available for an appointment, in February.

The whole process of finding a doctor and booking an appointment was very confusing. My company reccomends a site for searching for doctors, but the site doesn't allow you to book appointments as far as I can tell. So I found another site for booking appointments, but I wasn't able to log into that site, so I had to book as a guest. Is that how it's supposed to work? I'm not sure. I did check that the doctor is "in-network" and therefore covered by my insurance, so it should be okay, in the end...

This is why I procrastinated on doing this for years -- I really don't understand it at all. But I guess the only way to learn is by doing and making mistakes.

## Lost earbuds

A great tragedy today... I lost the wireless earbuds my dad just gave me!! Don't tell him, or he'll go buy me some new ones.

I don't know what happened. I remember taking them out on the bus but not putting them in my ears, and just letting them sit on my backpack. I don't remember what I did with them after that. Then, the moment I got off the bus, I noticed I hadn't put them in my backpack like I usually do, and I couldn't find them.

There's only two possible things that could have happened:

1. I left them on the bus
2. I dropped them within seconds of getting off the bus

My company has a pretty good system for finding items lost on buses. You report it to the transportation team, and then at a certain time each day they take all the requests from people for that day and go searching the buses. Unfortunately, they weren't able to find my earbuds.

Another possibility is another pasenger on the bus found them, picked them up, and turned them into a building. There is a master log of all turned-in items you can check online, but my earbuds weren't there.

So the only other possibility I can think of is that I dropped right as I was getting off the bus. However, I didn't think of this possibility until hours later. I returned to the bus stop to search the ground, but I couldn't find them.

Now I'm really disappointed with myself. I think I will buy some replacement ones though, since I was getting used to their benefits.

## The end of Inbox

I still use the alternative site for Gmail called Inbox. It looks different from standard Gmail.

Here's Inbox:

![Inbox](/images/blog_january/inbox.png)

And here's Gmail:

![Gmail](/images/blog_january/gmail.png)

(In these shots, I whited out some personal details)

Maybe you can see, the biggest difference between the two is the way they handle "reminders". In Inbox, they appear in the normal email list, and they can be snoozed like ordinary mail (dismissed until a time that you set, at which point they re-appear with a notification). Gmail doesn't have reminders like this, instead it has a "My Tasks" sidebar, but the reminders can't be snoozed and don't come with notifications.

Anyway, today I logged into Inbox and received a notification that it's going away and won't be available after March. I've known about this for a while, but the time has finally come.

I guess I am one of the last hold-outs using this very unpopular service. I just like the reminders feature a lot. It is so quick and easy to use, and I rely on it to remember all sorts of minor things, like when you ask me to wash your clothes for you.

I'm sad it's going away, but that is the way of things. Onwards to Gmail!

## Plaza del Sol

Today we visited downtown Sunnyvale with an old friend of ours. I'd been there briefly before but never had a chance to look around.

The main downtown street seems very small, even compared to Mountain View's. However, there is a nice plaza area we went to called Plaza Del Sol. It had some interesting designs on it, like one part that was like a maze, and another part that looked like a clock. I wish I had taken pictures, but I didn't!

There were also cool fruit statues, and something called a "Ball Tower". When the clock hits a certain time, balls roll through a contraption and hit chimes, creating music. We heard it but didn't see it!

Downtown Sunnyvale is a place I want to go back to and explore some more. I've lived here 3 years and haven't really been there, isn't that crazy? I want to see if there are more interesting restaurants and things there!

## New Year's goals

It's a new year and here are my goals for the year!

- Learn 1000 more kanji in WaniKani! (currently I am at 241)
- Set up regular doctor's appointments, and go to one!
- Set up regular dentist's appointments, and go to one!

I think that's about it. Otherwise, I want to keep on enjoying every day to the fullest! And I want to keep on loving you as much as I can! They say that love fades over time (is it because people take each other for granted?), but that's not going to happen for me! I will keep appreciating you with all my heart! This year, and every year.
