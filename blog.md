## Suddenly San Francisco

Today you called me out suddenly to meet you in San Francisco!

Riding the train and BART there, I thought about how it had been so long since I had last done so. It's pretty easy to get there, but such a hassle to get back, which is why I was thankful you offered to drive me back!

Once there we had hot chocolate of course!

On my quest to find good hot chocolate, this is probably the best. I like the bigger and lighter one, but the small and dense one is good too!

While we were in San Francisco, we did some walking as well. I thought this building was cool!

I like the colors, as well as the round portion on the corner, almost like a tower. I wish I had a round room with windows all around!
