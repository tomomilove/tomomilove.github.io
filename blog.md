# Lunar New Year celebration at work

Today they had a small Lunar New Year celebration during lunchtime at work. There were decorations, various games and activities, and themed food.

First, they gave us this red envelope and coin:

I didn't do many of the activities, but one I did do was drawing this character. They said it brings good fortune:

I didn't do a very good job. Though in my defense, they didn't give us any instructions. I wish I could learn the proper technique.

## Character profile: Lee

Here's a character profile for Lee, the character from _Kowagarijanai Chronicles_.

**Full name**: Lee Jae-Yoon

**Age**: 22 years old.

**Physical description**: Average height. Lean and muscular. Has long black hair that he often keeps in a rough ponytail of sorts. Currently his wardrobe consists of mostly pirate clothes, since he was traveling with ghost pirates on his previous adventure.

**Personality**: Chill and good-natured, makes friends easily. He's great at listening to people, and reading into them. Doesn't usually talk about himself, unless asked.

**Biography**: He doesn't have a particular profession, but describes himself as a "traveler", and gets into various adventures.

Lee was born into poverty and ran away from home at the age of 10 to seek greater things. He has been wandering the world ever since, and has never returned home. To name but a few of his adventures, he has visited the underworld, had tea with a god, traveled through time, died and got revived by a sacrifice from a phoenix, got stranded on a deserted island, and accidentally married (then quickly divorced) a princess. He has saved the world a few times, taken down a couple of evil empires, and more.

**Motivation for joining Alice's guild**: While sailing across the ocean, he saw Yggdrasil The World Tree on the horizon and couldn't pass up the chance for a new adventure. He joined Alice's guild because she needed someone to take the role of a defender, and he had never done that before, and thought it would be interesting.

**Things he likes**: Hearing the stories of other adventurers, and sharing his own.

**Things he worries about**: What compels him to wander the world so restlessly? Someone close to him once accused him of running away from his past. And, although he would never admit it to himself, perhaps he is searching for connection and love.

**People he is close to**: He has had many traveling companions over the course of his life that he became close to. However, he inevitably parted ways with each one, and moved on to the next adventure.

**Fighting style**: Lee is probably one of the strongest sword fighters in the entire world. However, during this current adventure, Lee takes up the role of defender instead, something he does not have much experience in. He stands with Alice on the frontlines of battles, using his massive shield to protect his allies from attack, and trying to draw the attention of enemies.

## Things that work, things that don't work (part 2)

Today I visited the AT&T store to get my new phone checked out. I was pretty sure that the phone itself was broken and there was nothing they could do to help. But I had to go for the due dilligence.

...And yeah, when I went there, they eventually concluded that the phone was faulty.

So then, when I got home, I contacted Google support again and requested to exchange the phone. It was a bit of a struggle. You really have to convince them that you have tried every possible thing before they let you do an exchange.

So that's done now. Hopefully the new phone arrives soon, but they didn't send me a tracking number and I have no idea how long it will take. I guess I just gotta wait.

Anyway, sorry the blog posts for the past two days have just been this long, negative story. The title refers to the fact that I was impressed by some things that worked really well, and frustrated by some things that didn't work. Ordering the phone was so easy, setting it up was so easy... but then because it didn't work, I had to go through a massive struggle of customer support and wasted time. By the end of this, I think I had to talk to 7 different customer service agents, and also had to involve my dad.

In hindsight, I think I should have just made a hard request to return the phone on the first day, and to not take no for an answer.

## Things that work, things that don't work (part 1)

So I ordered a phone today. The process was quick and easy. I ordered it while riding the bus to work, and it arrived later that afternoon. But when I moved my SIM card to the new phone, it couldn't be recognized. Uh oh.

I tried resetting the phone, taking the card in and out again, cleaning the card and card slot... but nothing worked.

Then I contacted Google customer support. I liked their customer support because you could do text chat instead of phone. They had me try a few things, but none of it worked. Then they told me to contact my carrier, AT&T. I was frustrated by this because it was clear something had to be wrong with the phone, not my service. The SIM card worked in my old phone, so the only thing that could be wrong was the new phone. But anyway, I went ahead and contacted AT&T.

That turned out to be quite a struggle. They also have a text chat support system... except you're not allowed to use it unless you log-in to your account. The problem was, I don't own the account -- my dad does. So I couldn't use the text chat system. I had to call them.

And that was a struggle, too. For one, my phone would randomly hang up sometimes when attempting to call them. I don't know why, because nothing like this ever happens when I call other people. But eventually I got through to them, then they put me on hold and I had to listen to some ads for a while. Then when I got to talk to someone, they couldn't help me unless I knew my account passcode. So I had to give up and call my dad to get that information. Then I called them back and they still couldn't come up with a solution for me. And so I had to go visit the store the next day...

## Kingdom Hearts III

My sister recently texted me about a game that just released called Kingdom Hearts III. It was a bit of a surprise because I don't usually get texts from my sister! But she is a big fan of the series, so she is excited about this new release. After all, Kingdom Hearts II came out in 2005, 14 years ago... that's about half of my sister's life!

Anyway, to give more context, this is a kind of a bizarre game series which is a crossover between various Disney movies, Final Fantasy, and original characters as well. Just look at these characters hanging out together:

I've never been a huge fan of the series myself, but part of me wants to play it to have something to connect with my sister over, since I don't talk to her very much these days.
