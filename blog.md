## Crazy cat show!

We saw some crazy cats at the cat show! It seems like they all take a certain characteristic to the extreme. They are either the most fluffy, or the most skinny. And they are quite large, and super well groomed.

As you said though, there potentially some troubling aspects to a cat show. The emphasis on pure breeds, or if the breeders are in it primarily to promote their cat's breed so they can sell it, or if the breeders have to drug their cats to get them to behave... Who really knows what goes on, but it wouldn't surprise me if competition brings out some shady things. 

Anyway, I wonder what the cats think of it all. I hope it's not too stresful for them, and it's a happy life!
