## Final Fantasy 9

I recently got a new game to play, _Final Fantasy 9_. This is a pretty old game, originally released 19 years ago, just now re-released on Switch.

This game has a pretty interesting history. It wasn't popular when it first released, probably because of its kind of silly and whimsical look. At the time, it was viewed as a big departure from the much more popular Final Fantasy 7, which had an edgier and cooler style. However, over time, 9's reputation has grown a lot.

I've only played a short ways into Final Fantasy 9 so far, but right now I'm really impressed with the game's story. The characters are all so detailed, even the minor ones. And the world feels so rich and filled with stories. I'm not sure who the writer for this game was, but whoever they were, they clearly loved writing lots and lots of stories. 

Here are some screenshots I took while playing the game. It uses an old graphical technique called "prerendered backgrounds". You can run around the world like it's 3D, but the environments are really just drawings. It's a cool look, you can see it lets them get pretty artsy with perspective and framing.

## Night walk

We took a nice walk to downtown and back today. I know it was flat, but I hope it wasn't too boring for you!

I really enjoy walking out at night, provided that the area doesn't feel dangerous and I'm not alone. I've liked being out in the night for as long as I can remember -- I remember when I was a kid, Halloween was always my favorite holiday because you got to walk around outside in the dark.

I'm not sure why I like. It's just so beautiful, I guess. I like looking into the houses with lights on inside -- they seem so cozy. Also the stars are out!

## More puzzles!

I didn't have much to do today, so I walked to the library and worked on the puzzle!

Here's the progress when I started:

And here's how far I got by the end:

![Puzzle after](/images/blog_march/puzzle_after.jpg)

Actually, it wasn't just me working on the puzzle! While I was working, some random person came and helped out for a bit. She was really fast at it, and did most of the sky area that I had been ignoring. I asked her how she was so good, she said she didn't really know, she just does it! Maybe it comes with practice.

## The life of a plumber

Today I got our kitchen sink faucet replaced!

![New faucet](/images/blog_march/new_faucet.jpg)

I had requested for it to be repaired, but the repiar person just brought a new faucet. I guess that works!

While he was repairing the faucet, the repair person was telling me about his life. It was pretty interesting actually. After I told him I grew up in Davis, he told me that he owns farm landdown there. He doesn't work the farm himself, but he pays people to do it. He also owns a 100 year old Victorian home on that farmland, which he renovated himself. This was surprising to me because I didn't think people owned farmland and then spent their day job as a plumber.

He also told me about other jobs he had. He used to work in the kitchen of a hospital. And he slowly rose through the ranks from dishwasher to the head chef. He said he worked that job for about 20 years, liked it, but then decided to do something different simply for the sake of something different. After that he went into gardening. Then he went back to school, studied gas and electric work, and from there got into repair jobs. He said he used to do repair jobs for a trailer park, but now he does them for my landlord. He says he finds plumbing to be fun.

If you ask me, it sounds like a pretty rich life. I like the idea of doing a bunch of different jobs. I think I don't want to do one job forever.

## Staying home day

I stayed home today to get our kitchen faucet repaired.

![Old faucet](/images/blog_march/old_faucet.jpg)

For a few days now it has been leaking constantly. I shouldn't have waited so long to get it repaired, since it's a lot of water wasted. But it's tough because I have to stay home from work to let the repair person in.

Today turned out to be a good day to stay home though, because I was a little sick.

Anyway, the repair person came... and then quickly realized he didn't have the right equipment, and told me he would have to come back tomorrow. So that's kind of a waste of a day off. However, he was very nice and told me he could come tomorrow after I got off work.

## Daylight savings

Thanks for telling me about daylight savings yesterday! Otherwise I don't think I would have noticed yesterday.

I would definitely have noticed today though! It was sunny as I went home from work. And there weren't even any clouds. It's such a simple thing, but it really does make me happier!

If it were up to me, we'd have daylight savings time year-round. The only arguments I've heard against it is that it would be dark in the morning when going to work, but that's only if you go to work as early as 7am. I get into work later, so daylight savings would be better for me in any case!

## Downtown day

My friend came to visit today! He said he wanted to try dim sum, so we went to the one downtown.

![Dim sum](/images/blog_march/dim_sum.jpg)

This place was pretty nice! It was a bit cleaner and fancier than I am used to from dim sum places. A little more expensive, too. I enjoyed the food quite a bit, but then again, I always like dim sum!

Afterwards, we went to the library to work on the puzzle a little bit. We made some progress!

![Puzzle progress](/images/blog_march/puzzle_progress.jpg)

Here's what the final picture would have looked like:

![Puzzle picture](/images/blog_march/puzzle_picture.jpg)

As you can see, it's a big but easy puzzle. It has lots of small details and distinct areas, making it quick to tell where any piece belongs! It also has a lot of words in it, which allows you to easily figure out the orientation of pieces.

I wan to go back and finish this puzzle sometime! I wonder if it'll still be there...

## Party day

Today was kind of a party day at work. My team manager planned a special lunch for us with catering, for no real reason. It was tacos, just like Mamacitas (but not quite as good). We even got churros and horchata!

![Tacos](/images/blog_march/tacos.jpg)

After that, we had a fun event. An instructor came and we built robots in teams and then battled them.

![Robot 1](/images/blog_march/robot1.jpg)

Here they are battling... The goal is to pop the other's balloon with a needle on your arm!

All in all, it was a pretty fun event!

## Losing things

It's been a bad year for losing things. First it was my wireless earbuds, then my hat, then my cup and teapot...

Another thing I have been slowly losing over time is the rubber tips that go on my earbuds. So far, whenever I have lost one, I have been able to replace it with tips taken from my old earbuds. However, I eventually ran out of those...

Then I remembered, when I bought my earbuds long ago, it came with this huge array of earbud tips!

![Earbud array](/images/blog_march/earbud_array.jpg)

I think it's funny to see them all lined up like this!

## Email authentication

When you send an email to someone, it's possible to write whatever you want in the sender address.

This poses a problem: When you receive an email, how can you tell that it's actually from who it says it's from?

Today, most email service providers implement some form of _authentication_, a method for determining whether the email sender is who they actually claim to be. I'll describe one such method, which is known as _SPF_ (Sender Policy Framework).

Imagine a scenario where alice@hotmail.com sends an email to tanaka@gmail.com. In this process, a computer owned by hotmail.com (Microsoft) communicates with a computer owned by gmail.com (Google).

When Google receives this message, it sees that the from address claims to be alice@hotmail.com. In order to check whether this is true, it must determine whether the computer it is communicating with is actually owned by Microsoft. If it is actually Microsoft, then Google will trust Microsoft that the message is really sent by alice.

So, how can Google know for sure whether the computer is actually owned by Microsoft?

There is only one piece of information that Google knows for sure about the computer it is communicating with, and that is its _IP address_. An IP address describes the geographical location of a computer in the real world. Google must know the IP address of the computer because it is exchanging messages with it, and Google has to know where in the real world to send the messages.

Since Google knows the IP address, all it needs to check is whether this IP address is owned by Microsoft or not.

In order to do that, Google does a _DNS lookup_ on "hotmail.com". The DNS (Domain Name System) is a globally available database of information about internet domains. Domain owners can register their domain here along with various information about the domain. In particular, Microsoft has registered an entry for "hotmail.com", and in that entry, they've included a list of IP addresses they own. All Google needs to do is check whether the IP address of the computer they are communicating with is in that list. This allows them to conclude the computer is owned by Microsoft.

And that is how the email authentication method known as SPF works.

## Double mentorship

Earlier I mentioned I was assigned to mentor a new engineer on the team. I have begun by giving a series of small talks going over our team's major systems.

Then, another new engineer on our team joined days later. I invited them to join my talks, so now I am teaching the two of them.

I enjoy it a lot. It reminds me of my days at school, lecturing. Except it's much nicer to teach such a small number of people. It reminds me, I used to want to be a teacher. Maybe someday...

## Council from friends

I had lunch with two of my old friends from college that work at the same company as me. They seem to be doing well. One of them, who hated their team for the longest time, transferred to another team and now likes it a lot. They now work on self-driving cars, at the building near where I live.

At lunch, they spent a long time trying to comfort and encourage me, because now the one who has been doing the worst at work. I've been here the longest, but I still haven't been promoted yet, or anything...

Struggling with promotion is something that increasingly weighs on my mind, as more time passes. It's hard to tell how much to blame myself, vs my team, vs my manager. Would I be better off switching teams? Or is it really up to me to try harder?

## Crazy cat show!

We saw some crazy cats at the cat show! It seems like they all take a certain characteristic to the extreme. They are either the most fluffy, or the most skinny. And they are quite large, and super well groomed.

As you said though, there potentially some troubling aspects to a cat show. The emphasis on pure breeds, or if the breeders are in it primarily to promote their cat's breed so they can sell it, or if the breeders have to drug their cats to get them to behave... Who really knows what goes on, but it wouldn't surprise me if competition brings out some shady things. 

Anyway, I wonder what the cats think of it all. I hope it's not too stressful for them, and it's a happy life!
