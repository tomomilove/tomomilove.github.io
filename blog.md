## Every day is special
Woohoo happy birthday!

Do you feel very different on your birthday? People will say you are now a year older, but in reality, you are only one day older. So maybe it’s not that big of a deal?

Actually though, I think birthdays are important, because they mark the completion of a year. Although you may not change very much on your birthday itself, you do change over the course of a year. So I think when we celebrate birthdays, really what we are celebrating is the experience of one year. That’s why I thought a year-long blog would be a cool birthday gift. My plan is to have an update mostly every day for one year (if I miss a day here or there, I'll make it up with multiple posts on a later day!). It is a gift that gives over the course of the entire year.

I’ll try to update the blog with things I did, saw, or thought about that day. I can’t promise it will always be interesting, but I'll do my best to keep it fun. After all, isn't every day special? I think there should be something worth remembering about every day!

To start off with, I’ve already added 10 blog posts (including this one). Please enjoy them!

## Normal tea vs milk tea
I bought Asha’s house black tea in order to recreate their milk tea, but recently I’ve found myself using it just to make regular tea.

TODO: picture

Do you remember my many attempts to create Asha's milk tea? I've gotten pretty close, but I haven't truly matched it, and I can't figure out what's off. I think the key must be in the sweetened condensed milk. I need it to provide thickness and richness, but if I add too much of it, then it creates an odd flavor. I'm not sure what Asha does to make theirs so perfect. Maybe they just add more sugar? 

Anyway, since I can’t quite get the milk tea right, I’ve given up on it for the time being. But that's only because I've found something better: the regular tea. I've just been making the house black tea following the normal instructions: 2 teaspoons of tea, 212 degree water, 2 minutes. Then I add a bit of sugar, and it’s perfect. It might actually be my favorite tea I’ve ever had!

Next time you come over in the afternoon, you should try it! It's better than coffee!

## Interesting things at work #2: A forest!
There’s this wall at work that’s supposed to look like a forest:

![Office forest](/images/blog_july/office_forest.jpg)

It’s cool, I guess? There’s a little pathway here: 

![Forest pathway](/images/blog_july/forest_pathway.jpg)

I really want to walk on this pathway! But I don't think you're supposed to. Maybe they should have just made the whole room a forest?

## Sneak peek at my Japanese notes!
I’ve spent a lot of my free time recently studying Japanese! Here’s a scratch sheet where I’m translating sentences:

![Japanese notes](/images/blog_july/japanese_notes.jpg)

Just for fun, I’ll walk you through my translation process:

1. First I just write out the sentence in Japanese by hand, in my notebook (I'm copying it from the computer screen).

2. When I come across a kanji, the first thing I do is take my best guess at the stroke order. Then I check it on jisho. I think I’ve getting decent at stroke order recently, although there are still some confusing ones.

3. As I’m looking at the kanji on jisho, I’ll write its kana above it in the notebook. This is because, when I’m all done with the sentence, I try to read it aloud to myself. However, by the time I’ve finished looking up the later kanji in the sentence, usually I’ve forgotten how the earlier kanji are pronounced. So I’ve got to have the kana there, otherwise I’m not able to keep it all in my head at once to read it smoothly.

4. As I’m looking at the kanji on jisho, I also take a mental note of what it says about radical and kanji parts. Memorizing kanji is hard, but I’ve found that learning the radicals and parts actually helps a little bit, even though they don’t always make sense.

5. Sometimes I write pieces of English translation under the text. I do this for the same reason I write the kana: By the time I’ve finished translating a later part of the sentence I have usually forgotten what the first part meant, so it helps to keep a quick English note. I think this is something I should try to do less and less, though.

As soon as I think I understand the whole sentence, I stop writing. So there might be some incomplete notes here, because I figured out what the sentence meant part-way through, and decided to move on.

## Shirt shopping
I just bought three shirts online! Hopefully they fit well, so I won’t have to return them!

I find buying clothes to be very difficult. One reason is that I have trouble finding clothes that fit. I am so short that XS size is best for me lengthwise, but unfortunately those are too tight for me in the shoulders. So usually I get size S, but these are too long for me. As a result, I feel that most of the shirts I have are a little too long for me!

Another reason I find buying clothes to be difficult is that I’ve accumulated a series of rules about what not to get. Here are some of them: 

1. No logos on the clothes. I want to avoid making any statements that would lead people to make judgments on my personality.
2. No collars that button down, as they are too fancy.
3. No plain t-shirts, as they are too simple.
4. No linen (linen is a fabric made from flax, which is different than cotton. Most clothes are made from cotton). The reason I avoid linen is that one time I owned a linen shirt and I found it to be scratchy.
5. Avoid short sleeves. My arms are too skinny, so they don't fit short sleeves very well.
6. Nothing black or white, as these colors are too extreme. Greys are okay.

Come to think of it, this is a very negative approach to clothes shopping. Maybe I should make rules for things I like, instead...?

## A postcard from the heart #1: The colors of summer
What’s this?

![The colors of summer](/images/blog_july/postcard.jpg)

Today I colored in this postcard! Do you remember that Tammy and Rachel gave me a series of postcards to color?

The theme for this postcard is “The colors of summer”. I chose colors to represent the sky and the sun, as well as earth and plants. The art is very abstract, so I thought I should choose colors based on the real world to counterbalance that.

When I was coloring this post card, I tried to make it so that no adjacent areas had the same color. However, I made a few mistakes. Can you spot them? (If you’re going to look, maybe wait until you have the actual postcard in hand, as it’d be easier than looking at this photo).

Coloring this postcard was an interesting experience. At first glance I thought the design looked pretty simple and symmetric, but the more I looked at it, the more I saw the irregularities. As I was coloring it in, I realized there are a lot of weird, one-off details, and it’s barely symmetric at all. I wonder what the artist was thinking when he drew it. He must have had fun breaking his own patterns.

By the way, this is a postcard, isn’t it? Could there be something written on the back...?

## Octopath Traveler
Recently I’ve been playing this game called Octopath Traveler. The main concept of the game is that there are eight main characters that each have their own story, but they meet up and travel together.

The game has a pretty distinctive visual style. It mixes together pixel art that is meant to be reminiscent of old RPGs from the early 90s, along with modern 3D environments and lighting effects.

One thing I really like about the game is the music. Here’s a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2gICtRg2UQ) showcasing the game’s orchestra recording one of the songs!

## Interesting things at work #1: Flowers
This flower-covered walkway at work is really pretty. It makes me happy to see it fairly well filled out. I’m looking forward to it growing more!

Did you know that Soda Hall (the computer science building at Berkeley) was supposed to have a vine-covered walkway in front of it? However, the vines never managed to grow big enough to fill it out, which always disappointed me every day. Soda Hall was also supposed to have plants growing on the roof, but they never put them there. If I was ever made an adminstrator at Berkeley, getting those plants there would be my first priority!

## Chipped tooth?
Something strange happened in my mouth the other day! There was some kind of sharp edge on my front tooth, and whenever my tongue brushed against it, it got hurt. It was right at the neutral resting position of my tongue, so my tongue was getting hurt constantly!

At first I thought it might have been something that got stuck between the teeth, but I could never find anything. So I think it might have been a chip. However, it largely disappeared after a day. What happened to it? Did the tooth heal (do teeth do that?), or maybe the edge just got sanded down? 

I’m glad it’s gone now, but one thing worries me: Where did the chip come from? Will it happen again? I didn’t notice when it happened, so perhaps I just bit my teeth during the night? That’s unfortunate because it’s not something I can control.

## New domain name, colors, and fonts
I’ve given this website a bit of an update!

Perhaps most apparent is some color changes. The background is a darker, softer blue that should be easier on the eyes. I also made the font white, and got rid of the yellow headings. I spent a long time playing with the colors to find a nice combination. My goal was to overall give the site a more sophisticated look. Do you like it? If it had been up to you, which colors would you have chosen?

I also spent some time picking a font for Japanese, since I plan to write some of the future blog posts in Japanese! I chose a font with rounded lines because I thought it looked more fun. However, I might change it after I write more text and get a better sense of what it looks like. I read some articles on Japanese typography, such as [this one](http://aqworks.com/en/blog/2016/09/20/perfect-japanese-typography/) and [this one](https://medium.com/@PavelLaptev/japanese-typography-on-the-web-tips-and-tricks-981f120ad20e), in order to understand how to properly add Japanese to this website.

Did you notice the site has a new domain name, too? It’s just [tomomilove.com](http://tomomilove.com) now. That domain is registered under your name. Congrutulations, you are now a domain owner!

I also made a few miscellaneous formatting fixes to this website. I decided to center pictures and give them a little border, and I also fixed some issues with the site header not displaying properly on mobile devices.
