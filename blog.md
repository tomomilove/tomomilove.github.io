## THE VILLAGE
The path through THE VILLAGE center opened up! You can walk all the way through now:

![THE VILLAGE](/images/blog_august/the_village1.jpg)

No stores are open or anything. Just the path. Anyway, it's a pretty nice path. There's a plaza-like area in the middle where cars can't get to, so it's nice for walking. I'll try going through here next time.

There's this art/statue/fountain too. It's that kind of typical generic corporate art that doesn't really mean anything or look very interesting:

Actually, I think there's something a little dystopian about THE VILLAGE:

I guess it's the way it uses the term "the village", but is actually the complete opposite of what a village is. To me, the word "village" brings to mind a small town, community feel, where everyone knows everyone one, and people have to work hard to scrape by. But this place is a fancy corporate shopping area.

But who knows, maybe it will turn out well. The plaza area is nice, and I like to imagine one day it will be bustling and full of life.

## The adventure begins
I wrote the first couple of chapters to my story, and I've posted them in a [new page](/story). Sorry, I'm sure there will be a lot of terrible problems with it, awkward grammar and odd word choice! I don't expect you to go through and provide corrections, as that would be a huge waste of your time. However, if you notice any major problems, or mistakes I keep making over and over again, I'd appreciate if you let me know! Also, if there's anything you don't understand about the story, feel free to ask me!

I should say, for future chapters, I probably won't post so much at once. However, for the beginning, I felt like I needed to post a decent chunk.

By the way, something you might not notice: The main characters in this story are based on the characters used in the example sentences in Tae Kim's website: アリス, ジョン, リー, 田中先生, and 山本先生. Since the purpose of this writing is to help me learn Japanese, I thought it made sense to keep using them. Now, please enjoy the story!

## Lights repairs
I did it! I sent an email to request someone come to repair our lights!

I wonder why I put off sending that email for so long. Why is it such a struggle for me? 

Maybe it's just a general sense of shyness, but I think there's something more. I think there's also a sense of guilt (behind most shyness there is guilt, isn't there?). Part of me feels that maybe I should have tried to fix the light myself. I would have had to get a ladder, figure out how to open the glass cover, then find a replacement bulb. I feel that I _should_ do that, yet I never actually do. But the feeling that I should prevents me from sending the email.

Actually, now that I've written this out, replacing the light myself doesn't sound so hard. I guess the most difficult part would be getting the ladder. I don't have a place to put it, or any other uses for it, so it seems like kind of a waste to buy one. On the other hand, I worry about wasting someone else's time, asking them to repair it.

What would you have done in this situation?

## ジョー書
As I mentioned in the previous day's blog post, I've been playing a game in Japanese.

Whenever I come across a word I don't know (which is nearly every word at this point), I look it up on jisho.org. That's fine and all, but how am I going to _learn_ this vocabulary for myself? Eventually, I should get to a point where I'm not looking up every word, right?

I've decided to write down every word I come across, along with its definition, on paper.

![Joesho](/images/blog_august/joesho.jpg)

This is very slow going at first, but eventually, I will start hitting duplicate words, right? Then I can look them up in my own handwritten dictionary (the "Joesho"... it's like a pun on "jisho", get it?), instead of looking them up online. I think that will help me learn better, if I rely more on resources I wrote myself. Also using handwriting should help with learning, right? I'm getting pretty good at kanji stroke order now, and I think that helps me remember some things.

However, there are so many words, I soon ran into the problem of how to organize them. For now, I've decided to organize them by the radical of the first kanji in the word, where each radical is a separate page.

Let me know if you have a better idea of how to organize these. I'm worried that as the amount of vocabulary grows, this organization scheme will no longer be good enough. Maybe I'll just have to to start cutting out less useful words.

## 世界樹の迷宮Ｘ 
So I've been playing a Japanese game I bought titled 世界樹の迷宮Ｘ. It's the newest game in the 世界樹の迷宮 series. I played the previous game in the series in English, and I enjoyed it.

The game is an RPG with a turn-based battle system, similar to Pokemon. Here are a few things this series is known for:
- It's quite difficult.
- The dungeons you explore are maze-like. Also, the game doesn't give you a map. Instead, you draw the map yourself as you go along, on the 3DS's bottom screen.
- There isn't much of a story, or a defined set of characters. Instead, you create your own characters, and you're encouraged to imagine your own story to go along with them.

That last aspect is why I thought it would be a good game for me to play in Japanese. I am planning to write out the story of my characters as I go along, for Japanese writing practice. This is the story I mentioned to you earlier. I think this is good because the game gives me some structure to work from: if I'm not feeling very creative, I can just write about the things that happened in the game. But when possible, I'll also try to tell the story of my characters and their personalities.

In this game, you can have 5 characters in your party at a time. They all fight together at once, and each one is supposed to have a different role in battle. For example, some of of your characters focus on attacking, then maybe one focuses on defending, and another focuses on healing. There is a huge variety of skills and abilities you can give your characters, and building a party whose skills work well together is the key to victory (much like in Pokemon).

I've already started planning some back stories and personalities for my characters, but it might be a while before I actually start writing the story. I'd like to progress through the game a bit more before I start. And as you might expect, my progress through the game is very slow.

## This blog now has multiple pages!
This blog has a lot of images, so I thought it would be nice to split into pages.

When you click the "Blog" button at the top, you now have the option to select which month's blog to view!

This functionality was made possible using the programming language [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). It's the first instance of JavaScript on this site.

Did you know that there are typically three programming languages involved on any given web page?

1. **HTML** is a programming language that defines the _structure and content_ of the page. In HTML, you decide where to place various elements (title at the top, footer at the bottom, etc). You also write the text of of the page in HTML, and place content within it, such as images.

2. **CSS** is a programming language that defines the _styling_ of the page. In CSS, you set the colors, the fonts, and how big or small elements are allowed to be.

3. **JavaScript** is a programming language that handles the _action logic_ of the page. You can write code that causes something to happen if a user clicks a button, moves their mouse, or types something in. In this case, there is some JavaScript code that runs when you click the "Blog" button.

Does using three programming language for one web page seem like a hassle to you? Because it totally is! For this reason (and many others), web development is a big mess. It's like this because when the web was originally designed, all it had was HTML. CSS and JavaScript were tacked on later, after it became clear that more options for styling and action handling were necessary.

## Automatic lights
My automatic light in the bathroom is really the worst. It always turns on when I don't want it (like when I need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and don't want to see bright light), and it always turns off when I don't want it (like when I'm standing still in the shower).

Well this time it decided to one-up itself in badness by becoming flickering. I find this very annoying. 

However, all hope is not lost. There is actually another light in my bathroom: A manual one by the mirror, which does not flicker. So I could use that one exclusively, if only I could prevent the automatic light from turning on (hard to do, since it's automatic).

Luckily I came up with a solution: Cover it up so it never turns on!

It seems to work kinda? Further testing is necessary, but this is a promising solution for now.

## Santa Cruz trip!
We went on an extended weekend trip to Santa Cruz!

Our first stop was a hidden, isolated beach. We had to navigate past several DO NOT ENTER signs that technically didn't forbid us from getting to the beach. Along the way we found these abandoned train tracks, overrun by grass:

![Train tracks](/images/blog_august/train_tracks.jpg)
I think there's something beautiful about them. We'd see them several times throughout Santa Cruz.

Later that day we headed to the Boardwalk, and you rode a number of crazy rides, such as these two:

![Fireball](/images/blog_august/fireball.jpg)
Are you really not scared when you ride these? Even on the small ride I did, I felt that if I let go of the handle bar I would have died. I guess that's not true, but that's how I felt!

The next day, we went to the forest of Nisene Marks, which is always beautiful.

![Nisene marks](/images/blog_august/nisene.jpg)
Here's you surrounded by forest. Isn't it majestic?

On the last day, we found some tide pools. Did you know these were here, or did we just find them randomly?

![Tide pools](/images/blog_august/tide_pools.jpg)
You really liked this spot in particular. I like it too!

It was an awesome trip overall! In the past I thought of the Boardwalk as a silly thing, but with you there this time I really did make some great memories there.

## Beefsteak
So a new lunch cafe opened up at my work called "Beefsteak". I heard it was burger themed. I'm not a huge fan of bugers, but I went to go check it out, since it is new, anyway.

When I got there, I learned it was actually a primarily vegetarian cafe! Their signature "beefsteak burger" is actually named for the [Beefsteak tomato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beefsteak_tomato). I guess the name is supposed to be a joke. They also had "poke bowls" on the menu, but with beets instead of fish (I'm not sure what the connection is there). Anyway, I'm not really a fan of tomatoes or beets, so I didn't end up getting anything.

I think if I had a vegetarian lunch cafe, I would put french onion soup on the menu, instead of tomato burgers! If you had to make a vegetarian cafe, what would your signature dish be?
