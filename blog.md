## Getting outside

I've been trying to think of way I can get outside more, to help with my vitamin D deficiency.

There's not too much place to walk around my work, but we do have a rooftop patio area. I decided to go take a look.

It's pretty nice! There's even a kitchen out here!

There's also these bocce ball courts that no one uses. You can tell because they're covered in weeds...

Actually, this whole area is typically pretty empty. Maybe more people will be here during the summer? For now though, it's a nice quiet place.

## Pills

So I went ahead and bought these vitamin D supplement pills.

I think I said this before, but it feels a bit embarrassing. Like I'm admitting that I'm not eating well enough, or getting outside enough, so I have to take these pills. But embarrassing or not, that's the reality of the situation. If these pills are good for me, I'll take them.

Actually, I've been having these for a couple of days now, and already I feel a bit healthier than before. I don't know -- I guess that's very likely to be placebo. But who knows, maybe vitamin imbalance really was contributing to me feeling unhealthy! That sort of thing really does affect people's state of mind.

## Penitencia Creek Park

Today we took a trip to Penitencia Creek Park. Who knew such a nice spot of green was in the middle of San Jose!

There was a really nice creek as well.

We saw some funny squirrels there! They ran around the ground, hid in holes, and liked to stand up straight. One of them was talking for a while, and the others would just stand and listen. I wonder what they were communicating?

I really liked this park and I want to go back!
