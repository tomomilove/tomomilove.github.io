## It's the holiday season, and you know what that means...

...snow animals return!

These are the only one's I've found so far. I'll let you know if I see more!

## Intern search

My intern project got approved, so now I have to go through the process of matching to an intern. I look at all the accepted interns along with their skills and preferences, then select three to talk with. If none of those work out, then I repeat the process.

I'm not sure the best way to choose an intern. I can read their personal blurb and see if their interests match my project. But I also feel drawn into reading into their personality... like do they seem down to earth and friendly? Or do they use a lot of PR speak and buzz words?

I wonder if it's right to care about stuff like that. The thing is, I don't need to evaluate their technical ability, because they have already passed interviews. I feel like any intern has the potential to do a good job. So what else is there to select for?

## Fall colors

During our Davis trip, I was really impressed by how beautiful the fall colors we saw were!

![Fall leaves 3](/images/blog_november/fall_colors3.jpg)
![Fall leaves 4](/images/blog_november/fall_leaves4.jpg)

However today, while I was downtown Mountain View, I was also impressed by the colors! Mountain View doesn't have quite as many trees as Davis, but it's still quite nice!

## de Vere's

On our last day in Davis for the weekend, we went to de Vere's Irish Pub for brunch.

![de Vere's 1](/images/blog_november/deveres1.jpg)
![de Vere's 2](/images/blog_november/deveres2.jpg)
![de Vere's 3](/images/blog_november/deveres3.jpg)

I don't know if I've ever been to a pub before, but this one was great! The rich wood and stained glass decor felt really cozy, and the food was delicious. The food was big and filling enough, but not too much to handle -- perfect for brunch before a long train trip!

## Crazy Rich Asians REVIEW

Head on over to [reviews](/reviews) to check out my review of this movie.

By the way, I skimmed the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Rich_Asians_(film)) on this film and learned two interesting facts:

- The film was a very large commerical success, becoming "the highest-grossing romantic comedy of the last 10 years, and the 6th-highest-grossing ever" (Though I have to wonder, does this movie really qualify as a "romantic comedy"? I'm no expert on the genre, but I felt the movie was more serious than comedic). 
- There is already a sequel in development.

## Thanksgiving Day

Happy Thanksgiving! Every day I am thankful for you to be with me. You are my dearest companion, and I love you so much.

Today we visited my parents house and ate with them and my sister.

![Thanksgiving](/images/blog_november/thanksgiving.jpg)

Pretty yummy meal! I thought the turkey was cooked quite well this time.

# 21 November
## First rainy day... ever!

It finally rained today! I think this is the first day it has rained since the blog started.

Since it rained, of course I have to go outside and walk around. I love seeing the world during or after rain. It's just so beautiful!

![Rainy day 1](/images/blog_november/rainy_day1.jpg)

I like the way plants look with water on them.

![Rainy day 2](/images/blog_november/rainy_day2.jpg)

Even the street becomes a thing of beauty.

![Rainy day 3](/images/blog_november/rainy_day3.jpg)

Neighborhood shot! I like how the rain causes leaves and petals to fall, scattering them across the street.

![Rainy day 4](/images/blog_november/rainy_day4.jpg)

Hey wait a minute! Leak in the apartment complex~

## Vote by mail application

My roommate recommended I vote by mail. Not a bad idea! I think it will be helpful to be able to sit at home and look up information as you fill out the ballot.

I wanted to do it this past election, but by the time I thought of it, it was too late. So I'll do it from here on out.

You can register to become a permanent mail voter, and they'll automatically send you the ballot. Useful!

To register, you just print out this piece of paper, fill it out, and send it in...

![Vote by mail](/images/blog_november/vote_by_mail.jpg)

It looks a little sketch, doesn't it? There's no kind of verification or anything.

# 19 November
## Sort By Controversial

Someone at work linked [this short story](http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/) called _Sort By Controversial_. I spent some of my work time reading it, whoops!

If you have some free time, consider reading it! Or at least speed-reading it.

My own personal review is that I didn't like the story very much. It is a bit too cynical and dramatic for me. However I did find one insight from the story interesting, which is the idea that sometimes the most controversial statements are the ones that seem most obvious. I don't know if that's true of all controversial statements, but maybe for some of them.

# 18 November
## Downtown trip

Today I went downtown to search for something for the white elephant gift exchange at work.

In the end I got this glass teapot. I don't know if people at work will find it exciting, but it's the best thing that I found.

![Glass teapot](/images/blog_november/glass_teapot.jpg)

While downtown I decided to try a restaurant I hadn't been to before: Hong Kong Bistro. I always wanted to try this place because Hong Kong style cafes usually give you free milk tea. And yeah, this one didn't disappoint!

![Hong Kong milk tea](/images/blog_november/hong_kong_milk_tea.jpg)

Surprisingly, the tea was totally unsweetened. They gave you a jar of sugar to add as much as you wanted. It was quite good!

Oh, and the food?

![Hong Kong Bistro](/images/blog_november/hong_kong_bistro.jpg)

It wasn't bad! Though the sauce on the meat was a little sweet, and combined with the milk tea there was just overall a bit too much sweetness.

# 17 November
## Smoky days

Wildfires have caused the past few days to be quite smoky. It's a shame, I want to be outside and walk around!

I read a [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/17/health/air-quality.html) about the air pollution. Here's what I learned from it.

- "A surgical mask, scarf, or bandanna will not filter out many pollutants at all." I guess my tenugui wouldn't do anything!

- The actual masks you should use are called "respirator" masks. They are available in different ratings based on the percentage of air particles they block.

- These masks may actually block so much air it makes it hard to get enough oxygen, potentially raising your heart rate and causing problems for certain people. So they are not for everyone!

# 16 November
## Ramen salad

Today at Shalala I tried ramen salad!

![Ramen salad](/images/blog_november/ramen_salad.jpg)

Oh no, the only picture I took of it was blurry...!

I have to say, it wasn't bad. The citrus sauce gave it a cool and refreshing flavor. Sometimes ramen broth can be too heavy for me, but this was just right!

# 15 November
## HealthEquity phishing advice

I received an email from my health savings account provider recommending I log into my account and check up on things. Surprisingly, there was no link in the email to log into my account. Then I realized I guess they don't want to appear like phishing. Pretty smart!

In fact, when I visited the website to check on my account, I saw they have [a page](https://healthequity.com/protect) specifically dedicated to anti-phishing advice.

![HealthEquity Phishing](/images/blog_november/healthequity_phishing.png)

Most of their advice is solid, but there are some I have issues with:

"
Don't save passwords in your browser: While saving passwords is very convenient, it makes it much easier for an attacker to access your account if your computer is compromised.
"

I don't know about that. Letting your browser handle your passwords is good if lets you use more unique passwords across websites (since you don't have to remember them yourself). Password reuse is probably a far bigger danger than your physical computer getting compromised.

"
Look for secure site indicators in any link: [...such as the 's' in 'https' or the green locked keypad icon]
"

This is not very good advice either. All legtimiate login sites will use https, that's true. But plenty (most?) fake sites use https as well.

# 14 November
## Survey survey survey

I feel as if I get a lot of surveys in my email these days. Today I took my (annual!) Computing Research Association survey. I'm not sure how I first received this survey, but apparently at the time I agreed to have it sent to me every year. I think I'm now on the third year.

They ask questions like: How did you get into a computing job? Do you feel like you belong in the computing community? Have you been promoted yet? And so on.

I said that I haven't been promoted yet, and also I don't feel like I belong. Thinking about it now, I wonder if there is a connection there? 

# 13 November
## Sick day

Today I stayed home from work out of sickness.

In the morning I wasn't quite sure if it was the right choice. "Maybe my sickness isn't so bad," I thought. But I think it turned out to be the right choice. All things considered, it has been a pretty mild sickness, but I was sneezing and coughing pretty much all day, and I don't think other people at work would have wanted to be around that.

Will it be gone tomorrow? Stay tuned to find out...

# 12 November
## Helping Tomomi on her homework

Today you called me, and we talked through your homework together. You had to prepare a discussion topic for class, and wanted to talk about it.

This made me really happy. It had been a week since I had seen you, and I was feeling lonely, so getting to talk with you was really nice! I'm not sure if I was helpful, but I hope it was a nice time for you too.

Also, it reminded me from my days as a lecturer. I used to practice my lectures every week by giving them to a friend. That was a 1.5 hour commitment from that friend every week... pretty intense. I think I gave my friend tea and snacks as thanks.

## Celebrating the cold weather

Today was the first day I was cold all day! I had to sleep with socks, wear my down jacket in my room, and so on. When I went to get dinner, my body was warm thanks to my jacket, but my face was cold. I haven't felt that feeling for a long time!

I can't say I really love the cold, but I will do my best to appreciate that it's hear. And I do that by getting hot chocolate at Esther's!

![Hot chocolate](/images/blog_november/hot_chocolate.jpg)

This is one of my favorite hot chocolates that I've had. It's really creamy, light, and fluffy! I wish I knew how to make it this way.

# 9 November
## Icon Theatre

So it turns out that the new theatre near where I live has been open for a while (even though the other buildings aren't finished). I went inside to check it out. Here's the entryway with a big hanging light:

![Icon theatre 1](/images/blog_november/icon_theatre1.jpg)

They also have some random photos on the wall? I'm not sure if there is a theme:

![Icon theatre 2](/images/blog_november/icon_theatre2.jpg)
![Icon theatre 3](/images/blog_november/icon_theatre3.jpg)

Further in, there is a place to buy tickets, which looks like a normal theatre. I didn't take any photos though, because there were security guards standing around and I didn't want to look suspicious.

I want to go see a movie at this theatre with you! However, there aren't currently any movies I want to see... But next time there is, I really want to see one with you!

# 8 November
## Recommendation from a friend

Today I had lunch with my friend at work. It has been many months since I last saw her. I wonder why I wait so long between the times I see my friends?

She told me tomorrow she is leaving on a trip to Korea and Japan. So I had to give her my #1 recommendation for what to do in Japan: buy the milk tea from the vending machines!

She also told me that sometimes she swims in the pool at work. I haven't tried it yet, but I should go one day. Then she gave me her recommendation for swimming: She said you should go swimming while it's raining, and then while underwater, look upwards and see the raindrops falling onto the water's surface above you. That sounds really interesting to me! I want to try it! I'm trying to imagine what it looks like, but I can't picture it.

# 7 November
## Lucky cat

They say black cats crossing your path is bad luck, but not this one! This cat from my neighborhood always runs over to me when I walk by. It is very friendly! So I think that must be a good thing.

![Black cat](/images/blog_november/black_cat.jpg)

I tried to get a picture, but it was difficult. I think the cat became bored because I was trying to get a picture of it, instead of spending time petting it.

# 6 November
## Voting

![Voting](/images/blog_november/voting.jpg)

I voted today.

Voting is pretty hard. I did my best to look up information on some of the different candidates, such as those running for city council, however all candidates consistently just write incredibly vague, samey phrases so I can't get a good understanding of them. Aside from that I have to vote on a lot of taxes and things, but there's never any specifics on what it will be used for or how much the money matters, so again, it's hard.

# 5 November
## Dreams. Wonder. Discovery. Possibilities.

Today I received some checks in the mail. I ordered them because I thought I would use them to pay my roommates for things like internet and electricity bills. However, after I ordered them, I was informed that it is possible to do that online. Oh well.

Anyway, the space themed checks I got were almost cool, but perhaps tried a little bit too hard to be inspiring? Here were some of the other options, though:

![Checks](/images/blog_november/checks.png)

What would you have chosen? Jeweled Elegance? Or perhaps you are a true Bee-liever?

# 4 November (bonus)
## Another story chapter!

Wow, two blog posts in one day? I'm adding another chapter of the story, since the chapter posted on 2 November was pretty short. As always, there's a [Japanese version](/story#２２章) and an [English version](/english_story#chapter-22).

## Beautiful Fall day

Many leaves have fallen from the trees around here, covering the ground. They don't bother to clean them up, but I like it this way. It's fun to stomp around in the leaves!

![Fall leaves 1](/images/blog_november/fall_leaves1.jpg)
![Fall leaves 2](/images/blog_november/fall_leaves2.jpg)
![Fall leaves 3](/images/blog_november/fall_leaves3.jpg)

It was sunny, but the air was cool. There are plenty of reasons why Fall is my favorite season!

# 3 November
## Party at Mamacitas

I went to Mamacitas Tacos today and discovered they have a snazzy new truck. Completely with some pretty fancy light rimming!

![Mamacitas 1](/images/blog_november/mamacitas1.jpg)
![Mamacitas 2](/images/blog_november/mamacitas2.jpg)

They seem to be pretty proud of their orange sauce as well:

![Mamacitas 3](/images/blog_november/mamacitas3.jpg)

I don't blame them, it's pretty good!

I think today they were having some kind of celebration for the new truck, because this time they had free horchata, pineapple, watermelon, and cake for everyone to eat. I guess they must be doing pretty well!

## Next story chapter

Alice and co. continue their adventure in the next story chapter is available [here](/story#２１章)! Also there is an [English version](/english_story#chapter-21)!

## Neat mnemonics

You were interested in some of the kanji and vocabular mnemonics in learn, so I've tried to recall some interesting ones for you. These are all from memory, so let's see if these mnemonics work!

六. Reading: ろく. Meaning: 6. This is made up of the radicals they call lid and fins. They say to imagine a monster with fins for its legs and a fan for its head running around, crazy, tearing everything up. Also, the location it is running around is hell, and everything is burning. Suddenly, it runs up to you, then lowers its head to show you its pan. On the pan, you can see the numbers written: 666, the sign of the devil! (That’s how you remember six). Then it gets out a guitar and starts playing some rock and roll, because rock and roll is associated with the devil. That’s how you remember ろく, you think of rock.

出す. Reading だす. Meaning: To take out. This is the exit kanji with す on the end. Imagine Sue (す) in a box, and you have to take her out. Also your dad (だ) is in the box too. What are you doing in the box, Dad?

出る. Reading でる. Meaning: To exit. This is the exit kanji with る on the end. る  as in room, imagine you need to exit a room, and fast. Why? Because there is a dead person (で) in this room! You feel you need to exit out of there fast… because you’re scared? (Or because you murdered them??)

八日. Reading ようか. Meaning: Eighth day, or eight days. Imagine you have a car (か) that runs on yogurt (よう). Not only that, you have to refill it about every 8 days. Isn’t that so inconvenient, 8 days? If it was 7 days, you could refill it the same time every week. But no, it has to be 8, forcing you to change your schedule all the time!

一日. Reading ついたち. Meaning: First day. One the first day of dating someone, you only get two (つい) touches (たち). Just two. You can hug them and give them a high five or something. Maybe you’ll go further on the second day?

白. Reading はく. Meaning: White. Imagine two teams: the white team and the black team, in a competition to see how can hack (はく) the iPhone first. The white team is clad all in white from head to toe, they’re in a pristine white room, and working furiously on a shiny white iPhone. Suddenly, they hold it up in victory! They did it! The white team wins!

田. Reading た. Meaning: Rice paddy. Imagine standing in the middle of a rice paddy. You bend down to take a closer look at one of the plants… and you discover it’s actually sprouting miniature tacos (た)! 

文. Reading ぶん or もん. Meaning: Writing. They say this comes from the doll radical. Imagine one of your dolls come to life while you’re not around and starts writing you notes demanding pork buns (ぶん). You find this rather creepy, both that it can write and the fact that it’s demanding buns. Why do you need buns? You’re just a doll after all. And a creepy one. Then it retorts (in writing): I’m not monster (もん)! Treat me with some respect!

右. Reading みぎ. Meaning: Right. They say this is made up of the mouth radical and the narwhal radical (just go with it, it’s narwhal because it looks like the ナ (na) character). Imagine a group of people on the political right trying to speak (using their mouths 口) on behalf of the narwhals. Can these people really represent the narwhals? And what are they demanding? Well, since they’re on the right, they’re really into military spending, and they’re demanding that we provide MiG fighter jets (みぎ) for them. Is that really what the narwhals need...?

左. Reading ひだり. Meaning: Left. This is made up of the narwhal and the construction radicals. Imagine a group of people on the political left also trying to represent the narwhals. But these people on the left think the solution is to build houses for them (that’s where the construction radical comes in). You travel to the arctic waters where the narwhals live, and you find a huge group of volunteers (college students and other people clearly on the left), building houses for the narwhals. You approach the group, and they all greet you by saying “Hidari!” You’re not quite sure what they mean. Are they saying “Hi dearie!” or something else? Is this some new young people slang you don’t know about?
