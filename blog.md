## Gochi

![Gochi 1](/images/blog_september/gochi1.jpg)

The two work teammates I mentioned earlier actually left the team today. We had a goodbye lunch at the Mountain View restaurant Gochi. It's a Japanese tapas restaurant. Didn't you tell me you had gone there...? Or was it somewhere else?

Anyway, while there we didn't order individual dishes. Instead, we just had them bring us various foods. And there was way too much! Anyway, here they were:

![Gochi 2](/images/blog_september/gochi2.jpg)
_Edamame! Yeah, that's pretty basic._

![Gochi 3](/images/blog_september/gochi3.jpg)
_Raw (?) shrimp. Wasn't a huge fan of this one, actually!_

![Gochi 4](/images/blog_september/gochi4.jpg)
_Sashimi, I think? Do you know what fish this is? My teammates were saying salmon, but I thought salmon looked different, unless this is some kind of variety._

![Gochi 5](/images/blog_september/gochi5.jpg)
_Some kind of kimchi pork dish._

![Gochi 6](/images/blog_september/gochi6.jpg)
_Some kind of orange chicken dish._

![Gochi 7](/images/blog_september/gochi7.jpg)
_A pizza... with some kind of crab and other seafood in it._

![Gochi 8](/images/blog_september/gochi8.jpg)
_Some beef. What are those things on top?? I tried to eat one, but they were very tough._

![Gochi 9](/images/blog_september/gochi9.jpg)
_A ball that had cheese, mushroom, and I think risotto inside? I didn't try this one, because of the mushroom..._

![Gochi 10](/images/blog_september/gochi10.jpg)
_A gratin._

![Gochi 11](/images/blog_september/gochi11.jpg)
_Ending rice!_

Correct me if I'm wrong, but this isn't very traditional Japanese food, is it? It seemed kind of fusion-y to me. But I don't really know.

## Calling a friend
(Friend's name ommitted for privacy. It's mutual friend CYI.)

Today I called my friend on the phone. It's been so long since I talked to him. I meant to call him on his birthday a while ago, but I didn't for some reason, and then I kept putting it off. You know how I am about being nervous with phone calls. But I also called you today, so maybe I'm getting used to it, and it's not so bad!

He seems to be doing well. He's doing research now, but says he kind of misses working with patients. He says he may come back to Sacramento to finish his med school. Then we can hang out with him again!

He also told me that he participated in a triathlon recently. Apparently he trained 1 - 2 hours a day, about 6 days a week for it. That's crazy! He said something like (paraphrasing), "I used to be that fat kid, but now I'm healthy!" So that's your feel-good story of the day!

Though every time someone says that, I start thinking about myself. Do I need to exercise, haha...?

## Roommate and Dragon Quest 11
(Roommate's name ommitted for privacy. It's roommate K.)

So, some days ago I had a dream that my roommate told me he was quitting playing video games. I think the reason had something to do with his girlfriend not wanting him to play games anymore, if I remember correctly? Anyway, I have no idea where this dream came from, or why. I don't recall thinking about anything of the sort prior to that dream.

Anyway, I mentioned this to my roommate and he said he thought it was quite ironic, because on that very day the game _Dragon Quest 11_ released. Dragon Quest is my roommate's favorite game series, and he said he had been waiting for this entry for 14 years\*.

_\*He probably meant this in reference to Dragon Quest 8, which released in 2004. Dragon Quest 9 and 10 released in the interim, but they weren't really what fans were looking for, since they were kind of spinoffs that eschewed from the traditional game structure that the Dragon Quest series had been known for._

After I told roommate K about the dream, roommate B chimed in and said next time I have a dream, I should go do exactly the opposite. I wonder if that's good advice!

Anyway, it has been several days since then, so today I asked roommate K what he thinks of Dragon Quest 11 so far, and if it has lived up to his expectations. He said he's about 2/3 of the way through the game, and to my surprise, he said it has exceeded his expectations and is now his favorite game of all time!

Wow! Imagine having 14 years of expectations surpassed! That's your feel-good story of the day, for sure!

## Funny phishing domains
As I mentioned earlier, part of my job is identifying phishing links. I manually look through these all the time, and honestly, it's often quite amusing. Some of the links are just so on-the-nose about the website they're spoofing, while others are funny because they're just so bizarre. Today I looked through over 1000. I wish I could share them with you, but I guess that's not public information. So instead I'll share some I found on a [PhishTank](https://www.phishtank.com/), a public database of known phishing links. Presented without comment, I can only imagine what some of these are supposed to be about...

## Kibi comes to visit
Today I brought Kibi to visit your house.

![Kibi in the couch](/images/blog_september/kibi_in_the_couch.jpg)
_Hi Tomomi! Here I am! Coming out of your couch!_

Kibi made a bunch of new friends, such as this girl:
![Kibi and the girl](/images/blog_september/kibi_and_the_girl.jpg)
_Nice kimono you've got there! I want one!_

And these fish:
![Kibi and the fish](/images/blog_september/kibi_and_the_fish.jpg)
_I am a hermit crab. Let me in the tank!_

Kibi also decided to become a tiger cub for day:
![Kibi and the tiger](/images/blog_september/kibi_and_the_tiger.jpg)
_I feel safe in your arms, tiger~_

Then decided to see what being food was like!
![Kibi is food](/images/blog_september/kibi_is_food.jpg)
_I better be as tasty as my namesake!_

Rolling with Koron:
![Kibi and Koron](/images/blog_september/kibi_and_koron.jpg)
_コロコロコロ。。。_

And Kibi even got into a fight!
![Kibi's fight](/images/blog_september/kibis_fight.jpg)
_My claws are sharper than your silly looking weapon!_

Dinner time!
![Kibi's dinner](/images/blog_september/kibis_dinner.jpg)
_Ramen!!_

I'm not sure what Kibi's doing now...
![Kibi will endure](/images/blog_september/kibi_will_endure.jpg)
_I will endure!_

Kibi wants to finish off the day with some gaming!
![Kibi gaming 1](/images/blog_september/kibi_gaming1.jpg)
_I'm going to win!! I'm going to beat you!!_

Uh, Kibi...? You do realize this is a cooperative game, right?
![Kibi gaming 2](/images/blog_september/kibi_gaming2.jpg)
_How do I win?!_

The long day comes to a close, and now it's time for Kibi's favorite game: hide-and-go-seek! Where could he be?

## 428: Shibuya Scramble
Recently I've been playing a game called _428: Shibuya Scramble_. 

![Shibuya Scramble](http://spike-chunsoft.com/428/img/keyart.jpg)

The genre of this game is called visual novel. As the name suggests, primarily it's just a story that you read, along with pictures, music, and some sound effects. In this game, the pictures are actually photos, not drawings or computer graphics, which is fairly rare among games.

Since this is a game, there is also some interactivity: at certain points, you can choose actions for the characters to take, which changes what happens in the story. 

There are 5 main characters, and each has their own storyline. Choices you make for one character often impact the other characters. Each of the characters is either directly or indirectly related to the game's central plot, which is about a kidnapping that happens in Shibuya. For example, one of the characters is a detective on the case, and you follow him trying to resolve the kidnapping. Other characters are less directly related to the kidnapping plot. For example, one of the characters is a woman dressed up in a mascot costume working to advertise for a weight loss product in order to make some quick money. Her story is not directly related to the core plot (so far, as far as I can tell), but the choices she makes do impact what happens to the other characters, which is always interesting to see.

It's a very interesting game so far. I'll let you know more about what I think of it when I've finished!

## Alviso trip!
Today we took a trip to some parks in Alviso. Honestly I didn't even know Alviso existed before today, so that was interesting. The parks were nice as well!
![Alviso 1](/images/blog_september/alviso1.jpg)
![Alviso 2](/images/blog_september/alviso2.jpg)
![Alviso 3](/images/blog_september/alviso3.jpg)

I really liked this building, too. I think it's beautiful.

![Alviso 4](/images/blog_september/alviso4.jpg)
![Alviso 5](/images/blog_september/alviso5.jpg)

Did you notice that I like these kind of short, brown looking buildings? I guess it's their more natural and humble look that I appreciate. This building also seems to have a cool upper floor lookout. I want to try it!

## Haircut + Zareen's trip!
Today I got a haircut! The instructions I give to the person who cuts my hair is "Number 3 on the sides, and about 1 inch left on top". Number 3 refers to the length of razor, I think. I'm guessing you don't give instructions like that when you get your hair cut, huh?

The haircut truck only comes to the main campus of my work, not the campus that my desk is at. So whenever I get a haircut I also make sure to take a trip to the Indian restaurant Zareen's, which is nearby! 

Zareen's is an eclectic place. I think we should definitely go there together one day! Remind me the next time we are thinking of going out to dinner. 

One odd thing they have is a shelf of books.

![Zareen's](/images/blog_september/zareens.jpg)

I wonder if anyone actually reads them...?

## Fight scene!
A new chapter of the story is available! Kowagarijanai encounters a new danger in their exploration of the labyrinth. The latest chapter is [chapter 11](/story#１１章).

## Leaving teammates
This week two of my teammates at work announced they are leaving the team. One is going to another team, the other to another company. One of them is a huge loss for the team, as they were always really helpful to me and everyone. The other I didn't interact with much, since they were working on a fairly peripheral project. So peripheral, in fact, that I wonder if it will continue after they leave.

No matter how many times people leave, I never get used to it. Usually what happens is that the person sends an email, and then they are gone within a week. It always makes me feel bad when this happens: I guess because it's so sudden, and it feels so cold and emotionless. I feel like I want to be able to talk to them, reason with them, and convince them to stay, but of course that is impossible. By the time they've sent the email, the plans are already well in motion, the offers already signed, and so on.

Whenever a teammate leaves, I always wonder if I played a small part in it. If I had been nicer to them, more sociable, would they have stayed? Maybe I alone couldn't have changed anything, but still, perhaps I could have played a better role than I did. I resolve to try to be nicer to my remaining teammates.

## Fast internet
So I splurged to get ethernet, and I think it was a good decision! It has been so far, so good today.

![Fast internet](/images/blog_september/fast_internet.png)
Look, Google even describes my internet as _fast_ now!

I should have done this ages ago! Honestly, I wonder why I never considered it? I guess because I didn't even know powerline adapters existed.

## _Poems of Friendship_
I finally got around to reading this book. I can't quite remember when or why I received it. Did Tammy and Rachel give it to me? Was it for my birthday, or for some other reason?

![Poems of Friendship](/images/blog_september/poems_of_friendship.jpg)

There were some nice poems in here. I already ready you my two favorites. One of them, _Friendship_ by Dinah Maria Mulock Craik, says that a friend should do the following for all the things their friend says:

    "Take and sift them--
    Keep what is worth keeping--
    And with the breath of kindness
    Blow the rest away."

Kind of harsh, but not necessarily bad advice!

Another, _My Familiar_ by John Godfrey Saxe, complains of a friend who stays too long. It contains some witty couplets like:

    He takes the strangest liberties,--
        But never takes his leave!"

and

    "He opens everything he sees--
        Except the entry door!"
    
Here's another one I liked. It's _Friendship_ by Ella Wheeler Wilcox:

    "Dear friend, I pray thee, if thou wouldst be proving
        Thy strong regard for me,
    Make me no vows. Lip service is not loving;
        Let thy faith speak for thee.

    Swear not to me that nothing can divide us--
        So little such oaths mean.
    But when distrust and envy creep bseide us,
        Let them not come between.

    Say not to me the depths of thy devotion
        Are deepter than the sea;
    But watch, lest doubt or some unkind emotion
        Embitter them for thee.

    Vow not to love me ever and forever,
        Words are such idle things;
    But when we differ in opinions, never
        Hurt me by little stings.

    I'm sick of words: they are so lightly spoken,
        And spoken, are but air.
    I'd rather feel they trust in me unbroken
        Than list thy words so fair.

    If all the little proofs of trust are heeded,
        If thou art always kind,
    No sacrifice, no promise will be needed
        To satisfy my mind."

I want to take this one to heart. I tell you I love you a lot, but I want it to be more than words.

I haven't read poetry in a long time -- probably never since school? I found it nice to read some now, though. Sometimes poetry gets a bad rap for being boring or obtuse, but I think a good poem can delight with it's structure and word choice. For example, the poem about the friend who never goes away is a lot of fun because of its repetitive and rhythmic structure.

## Los Altos day!
A day where both of us were free to have fun! We took a trip (well, a walk) to Los Altos!

No trip to Los Altos is complete without going to Satura Cakes! Although this time, we didn't get a cake, just a peach soda.

![Peach soda](/images/blog_september/peach_soda.jpg)

It was pretty good! A little syrupy at first, but it was good after the ice melted a little. I would buy a canned version, maybe!

Next stop, the library!

![Los Altos library](/images/blog_september/los_altos_library.jpg)

It's kind of hidden away, isn't it? Kind of a contrast to the taller, more regal building that is the Mountain View library.

I took a walk around the building and discovered some nice trees. This one was large and beautiful. I can't quite remember, but I think it was a valley oak tree?

![Los Altos tree 1](/images/blog_september/los_altos_tree1.jpg)
![Los Altos tree 2](/images/blog_september/los_altos_tree2.jpg)

I also found this sign pointing to Los Altos's sister cities:

![Los Altos sister cities](/images/blog_september/los_altos_sister_cities.jpg)

Finally, we had dinner at Cafe Nur, a mediterranean restaurant. We both got the same thing: Lamb and beef doner plate!

![Cafe Nur](/images/blog_september/cafe_nur.jpg)

It was great, though it still doesn't match (the now out-of-business) Athineon in Berkeley. I still have never managed to find doner that matches the softness of the doner at Athineon.

![Free tea](/images/blog_september/free_tea.jpg)

We got free tea at Cafe Nur though!! Do you think I will be able to give away free tea at Koala Tea?

# 1 September
## Tiramisu 2

Today I made tiramisu again! It was so good last time that I just had to make it at least once more!

Here I am layering it...

![Tiramisu layer](/images/blog_september/tiramisu_layer.jpg)

Done!

![Tiramisu extra](/images/blog_september/tiramisu_extra.jpg)

Me: Huh? There's someone extra on top! What are you doing here?

Extra thing: I'm here to help keep the plastic wrap from touching the cream! That's useful, right?

Me: Uhh, I guess that's useful??
