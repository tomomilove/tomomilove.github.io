## This blog now has multiple pages!
This blog has a lot of images, so I thought it would be nice to split into pages.

When you click the "Blog" button at the top, you now have the option to select which month's blog to view!

This functionality was made possible using the programming language [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). It's the first instance of JavaScript on this site.

Did you know that there are typically three programming languages involved on any given web page?

1. **HTML** is a programming language that defines the _structure and content_ of the page. In HTML, you decide where to place various elements (title at the top, footer at the bottom, etc). You also write the text of of the page in HTML, and place content within it, such as images.

2. **CSS** is a programming language that defines the _styling_ of the page. In CSS, you set the colors, the fonts, and how big or small elements are allowed to be.

3. **JavaScript** is a programming language that handles the _action logic_ of the page. You can write code that causes something to happen if a user clicks a button, moves their mouse, or types something in. In this case, there is some JavaScript code that runs when you click the "Blog" button.

Does using three programming language for one web page seem like a hassle to you? Because it totally is! For this reason (and many others), web development is a big mess. It's like this because when the web was originally designed, all it had was HTML. CSS and JavaScript were tacked on later, after it became clear that more options for styling and action handling were necessary.

## Automatic lights
My automatic light in the bathroom is really the worst. It always turns on when I don't want it (like when I need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and don't want to see bright light), and it always turns off when I don't want it (like when I'm standing still in the shower).

Well this time it decided to one-up itself in badness by becoming flickering. I find this very annoying. 

However, all hope is not lost. There is actually another light in my bathroom: A manual one by the mirror, which does not flicker. So I could use that one exclusively, if only I could prevent the automatic light from turning on (hard to do, since it's automatic).

Luckily I came up with a solution: Cover it up so it never turns on!

It seems to work kinda? Further testing is necessary, but this is a promising solution for now.

## Santa Cruz trip!
We went on an extended weekend trip to Santa Cruz!

Our first stop was a hidden, isolated beach. We had to navigate past several DO NOT ENTER signs that technically didn't forbid us from getting to the beach. Along the way we found these abandoned train tracks, overrun by grass:

I think there's something beautiful about them. We'd see them several times throughout Santa Cruz.

Later that day we headed to the Boardwalk, and you rode a number of crazy rides, such as these two:

Are you really not scared when you ride these? Even on the small ride I did, I felt that if I let go of the handle bar I would have died. I guess that's not true, but that's how I felt!

The next day, we went to the forest of Nisene Marks, which is always beautiful.

Here's you surrounded by forest. Isn't it majestic?

On the last day, we found some tide pools. Did you know these were here, or did we just find them randomly?

You really liked this spot in particular. I like it too!

It was an awesome trip overall! In the past I thought of the Boardwalk as a silly thing, but with you there this time I really did make some great memories there.

## Beefsteak
So a new lunch cafe opened up at my work called "Beefsteak". I heard it was burger themed. I'm not a huge fan of bugers, but I went to go check it out, since it is new, anyway.

When I got there, I learned it was actually a primarily vegetarian cafe! Their signature "beefsteak burger" is actually named for the [Beefsteak tomato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beefsteak_tomato). I guess the name is supposed to be a joke. They also had "poke bowls" on the menu, but with beets instead of fish (I'm not sure what the connection is there). Anyway, I'm not really a fan of tomatoes or beets, so I didn't end up getting anything.

I think if I had a vegetarian lunch cafe, I would put french onion soup on the menu, instead of tomato burgers! If you had to make a vegetarian cafe, what would your signature dish be?
