## Double mentorship

Earlier I mentioned I was assigned to mentor a new engineer on the team. I have begun by giving a series of small talks going over our team's major systems.

Then, another new engineer on our team joined days later. I invited them to join my talks, so now I am teaching the two of them.

I enjoy it a lot. It reminds me of my days at school, lecturing. Except it's much nicer to teach such a small number of people. It reminds me, I used to want to be a teacher. Maybe someday...

## Council from friends

I had lunch with two of my old friends from college that work at the same company as me. They seem to be doing well. One of them, who hated their team for the longest time, transferred to another team and now likes it a lot. They now work on self-driving cars, at the building near where I live.

At lunch, they spent a long time trying to comfort and encourage me, because now the one who has been doing the worst at work. I've been here the longest, but I still haven't been promoted yet, or anything...

Struggling with promotion is something that increasingly weighs on my mind, as more time passes. It's hard to tell how much to blame myself, vs my team, vs my manager. Would I be better off switching teams? Or is it really up to me to try harder?

## Crazy cat show!

We saw some crazy cats at the cat show! It seems like they all take a certain characteristic to the extreme. They are either the most fluffy, or the most skinny. And they are quite large, and super well groomed.

As you said though, there potentially some troubling aspects to a cat show. The emphasis on pure breeds, or if the breeders are in it primarily to promote their cat's breed so they can sell it, or if the breeders have to drug their cats to get them to behave... Who really knows what goes on, but it wouldn't surprise me if competition brings out some shady things. 

Anyway, I wonder what the cats think of it all. I hope it's not too stressful for them, and it's a happy life!
