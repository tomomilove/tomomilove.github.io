## Super Smash Bros. Ultimate

The latest game in the Super Smash Bros. series just released! We played together over the past couple of days and it was a lot of fun! Today I played more by myself.

This one is called "Ultimate" because it brings back every character from every past game, and most of the stages, too! Plus some new stuff.

So there are quite a lot of characters in this game. How many do you recognize?

By the way, I discovered that Isabelle dances like I do!

You go, Isabelle!

## Maison Alyzée

Today we tried the new French bakery at downtown!

We had a bit of a wait to get our dish, but in the end, I really liked it!

The chocolate tart you got was, as you said, a little too similar to eating a chocolate bar. Not bad, but maybe it could have used something light and fluffy, or something cakey, in order to differentiate it?

The _signature delice pecan_ I got, though, was fantastic. I loved how soft the filling was. But the flavors were the standout. And I'm not talking about the pecan and maple flavors, although those were good. I'm talking about the incredible vanilla flavor. Vanilla has a reputation for being boring, but here (and in macarons I have tried) it is really quite fantastic. Perhaps vanilla is a mostly forgotten art?

## White elephant gift exchange

Today at work we had our white elephant gift exchange. I received a double-walled thermos. Not the most exciting gift, but I never had a chance to trade it for anything else. Maybe it's karma for me talking up double-walled cups so much!

That said, I'm not sure if there was a gift I would have preferred instead. At the exchange, the other gifts included a huge nerf gun, a dinosaur-shaped cookie jar, M&Ms with stuff related to our work printed on them, a couple of board games, a stuffed toy, and a figurine. What would you have picked?

Come to think of it, the gift I brought was a little boring too. Next year, I'll try my best to think of something crazy to bring...!

## So what is eggnog anyway?

So they have eggnog in the kitchens at work now. I don't remember ever trying eggnog before, so I decided I had to give it a go!

It tasted like... thickened milk, mixed with candy canes (?) or maybe cough syrup (?). But also somehow pretty good??

Anyway, having no idea what eggnog actually is, I decided to look it up. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggnog), it's basically just sweetened milk mixed with raw egg and some kind of alcohol, and maybe some flavorings. I guess the version I tried didn't have alcohol, though. Fun fact: according to Wikipedia, eggnog used to be known as "milk punch"!

## Postcard from the heart #2: Cozy cafe

It's our third year relationship anniversary! So I made you this card.

![Postcard #2](/images/blog_december/postcard2.jpg)

What could be written on the back?

The coloring of this card is meant to look like Kibi is sitting inside a cafe. There are two large windows looking out into a sunset. The bright colors of the outside are meant to contrast with the cool, muted colors of the interior. Can you see it?

By the way, in order to celebrate our relationship anniversary, I wanted to go a certain place with you! It will only take an hour or two, so please go with me this weekend (or another weekend soon)?

## Adventures in the labyrinth continue

It's been a while since we last heard from Alice and co. I tend to post story entries when not much else interesting happened that day. But these last few weeks have had a lot of events. I guess that's the nature of the holiday season!

Anyway, last time, Alice and friends spent the night camping in the forest after a day of exploring. The latest chapter is [here](/story#２４章), English version [here](/english_story#chapter-24).

## Intern calls

I had to call a few intern candidates to see if they are a good fit for my project. The intern candidates may be nervous about doing these calls, but actually, I am probably more nervous than them!

A couple of the calls were difficult, and I wasn't sure what to say some of the time or how to get the intern candidate interested in the project. However, there was one candidate that seemed to instantly understand what was interesting about the project. That candidate seemed really excited about it, so I hope it works out with that one.

## Tofugu podcast

I learned that Tofugu, the company that makes WaniKani, has a podcast (and a blog). They are in English, and they cover Japanese language or culture topics.

I decided to check it out today, and listened to two podcast episodes. One was about transitive / intransitive verbs. The other was about name enders, like -san, -chan, etc.

In the first episode, I learned that Japanese usually has different words for the transitive and intransitive versions of an action (for example, 入れる and 入る). English, similarly, sometimes has different words for the transitive and intransitive versions of action (for example, "to insert" and "to enter"). However, English oftentimes does not have a separate word for intranstive actions, and instead just uses passive voice (for example, "to open" and "to be opened"). Curious!

In the second episode, they talked about different scenarios when you would use different name enders. It's useful to hear this additional context that you wouldn't learn from just studying vocab.

## Holiday party 2018

We went to my company holiday party today!

![Holidy party 1](/images/blog_december/holiday_party1.jpg)

The venue looked pretty nice! Although I should say it was a little small for the number of people there were.

They had a large Christmas tree there that was really pretty!

チカチカチカ・・・


I was a little surprised to see it there actually, since I don't remember the past parties having any references to Christmas.

The activities at the party weren't so interesting this time, so we spent most of the time eating food!

One of the more interesting things they had there was coconut water:

You didn't seem to like it. I don't think I did either? It's complicated; I'm not sure how I feel about it. Maybe it would be good with sugar...?

We were worried about a lack of desserts at the party, but the pecan pies came in at the end!
