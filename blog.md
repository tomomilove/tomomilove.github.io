## Holiday party 2018

We went to my company holiday party today!

The venue looked pretty nice! Although I should say it was a little small for the number of people there were.

They had a large Christmas tree there that was really pretty!

チカチカチカ・・・


I was a little surprised to see it there actually, since I don't remember the past parties having any references to Christmas.

The activities at the party weren't so interesting this time, so we spent most of the time eating food!

One of the more interesting things they had there was coconut water:

You didn't seem to like it. I don't think I did either? It's complicated; I'm not sure how I feel about it. Maybe it would be good with sugar...?

We were worried about a lack of desserts at the party, but the pecan pies came in at the end!
