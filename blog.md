## Trying some old games

I signed up for Nintendo's online service, and as a part of it, they give you a collection of old NES games to play for free. If you don't know NES, it was Nintendo's first console! Anyway, I decided to try a few I hadn't played before!

_Kirby's Adventure_

First I tried out _Kirby's Adventure_. This game is really unique for an NES game! A lot of games of this era were very difficult, but Kirby bucks the trend by being quite easy. It's also one of the nicest looking games of the time!

There was this cute claw machine minigame!

_Ninja Gaiden_

_Ninja Gaiden_, on the other hand, is known for being very difficult. I tried it and it wasn't so bad though. I was surprised that this game actually takes place in the modern world -- you travel through areas like back alleys of an American city, you fight soldiers with rocket launchers, and things like that... the whole thing feels extremely 80s action film, which I find really funny!

I was surprised it has pretty stylish cut scenes and an involved story, as well!

_Punch-Out!!_

In _Punch-Out!!_ you play as the boxer Little Mac, and fight boxing matching against imposing, cartoonish opponents. Do you remember Little Mac from Super Smash Bros? I used him when we played together that one time!

This game is all about recognizing what moves your opponent is going to do, so you can dodge in the correct way, and choose the right counter-attack. It's actually pretty fun and unique!

## More fuubutsushi

I read about halfway through 日本風物詩! Here are three interesting things I learned from it. I wonder if you already know most of the things in this book, though...?

![Daruma](/images/blog_july2/daruma.jpg)

Daruma are apparently meant to be the Indian Buddhist priest Boddhidharma. The reason they have no legs is that, purportedly, he meditated so long that he could no longer use his legs. And their eyes are wide because he cut off his eyelids in order to prevent himself from falling asleep. Some daruma are weighted in the bottom, so if you tip them, they will right themselves -- this symbolizes how he never gave up!

![Mizuhiki](/images/blog_july2/mizuhiki.jpg)

The cords used for wrapping gifts in this style are known as mizuhiki (水引). I liked this one because the book says gifts are wrapped carefully due to the custom that gifts are not supposed to be opened in front of the gift giver. I like that custom! Everyone should adopt it!

![Uta-garuta](/images/blog_july2/uta_garuta.jpg)

It says there is a card game based on 百人一首, that book of poems your mother gave me! The game is called 歌がるた. The way it works is there are a bunch of cards laid out on the ground containing the second half of each of the poems. Someone reads one of the poems allowed, and then people have to grab the correct card. It sounds kind of fun!

## You told me to eat more fruit

So I looked more closely at the fruit available at my work. I found this:

![Medjool date](/images/blog_july2/medjool_date.jpg)

It's a medjool date! Have you ever had it before? I tried it, and it was... extremely good! I was super shocked, because it has a bit of a weird appearance! It was basically like candy, both with its sweetness and its consistency. I could eat this fruit all day!

With a taste like that, though... Is it healthy? I went did some searching online, but I couldn't tell which sources were reputable. Anyway, from what I could gather, it does have a very high amount of sugar in it, but apparently it's not as bad for you because of the fiber in the date, so it gets absorded into your body more gradually. And it has other nutrients on top of that. Still, it's probably not a good idea to eat a ton of them, unfortunately...
