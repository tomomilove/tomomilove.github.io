## 世界樹の迷宮の終わりです

So I finally finished 世界樹の迷宮X, the game that Kowagarijanai Chronicles is based on!

Not sure if you've been keeping track, but I've been playing this game since August. It took me about 240 hours of playtime to beat. There's actually even more to do in the game after the ending, including an extra hard dungeon and some extra hard bosses, but I think I'm ready to move on from it now, even though I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Also, rest assured, the story Kowajarijani Chronicles will continue! Although it is pretty far away from the ending. Also, I'm planning to deviate from the game's plot significantly.

I'm thinking about what game I'd like to play in Japanese next. I have one in mind, but I think I'm going to wait until I've learned some more kanji and vocab first. In the meantime, I may return to the Pokemon game you gave me.

## Humanoid crane

I still receive emails about meetings for our old origami club. About a month ago, I received one that said they were going to make a humanoid crane. I had always wanted to build this model actually, but never thought I could find the diagrams. However, the email mentioned the original artist's name, Sasade Shinji, so I decided to go look for them.

I was able to find some low quality ones online! So I went to fold the humanoid crane! Here is what it is supposed to look like (photo not mine):

And here's mine:

It turned out all right! My only regret was not using larger paper. It was a fun build though!

## Performance rating

I received my semi-annual performance rating today. The rating I got was "exceeds expectations". Contrary to its name, this is actual the normal expected rating, because everyone is expected to exceed their role.

This is better than I had done the past two times though, so I guess it's a personal improvement. I still feel infinitely far away from a promotion though, unfortunately.

I think my primary feedback was that I need to deliver more impactful results. Ah, it's so difficult...
