## Doctor's appointment

I had my doctor's appointment today. I learned the technical term is 'physical'.

The doctor made some checks on me, but mostly spent a long time questioning me. Asking me about my sleeping, eating, and exercising habits. I realize I haven't been super healthy. I feel like such a child: not sleeping enough, eating too many sweets and unhealthy food, and not worrying about the consequences. And this doctor is like my mom, here to remind me to have restraint...

The doctor also gave me a tetanus shot, told me to get a vision exam, and said I should return after fasting to get lab tests done. I looked into it but I think I won't get a vision exam because I don't have vision insurance. I'll have to return for the lab tests though.

Anyway, this completes 2/3 of my new year's resolutions! It took me longer than I hoped to resolve them, but I learned a lot along the way.

## Taxes

Taxes are filed and accepted!

No refund for me -- I actually had to pay quite a lot. I don't really get how this works. Why do some people get refunds and others not? I understand it has to do with overpaying or underpaying taxes throughout the year (maybe?), but I'm not sure why that would or wouldn't happen. I don't recall making any choices related to that.

I used TurboTax to file, but I still found it to be quite a stressful process. So many things to check, so many facts I'm not sure of, so many terms that I don't understand. And there is the threat that if you mess up, there will be consequences.

It's been a rough past two days. Both days I kind of felt like I was being beaten up on. I'm glad to put it behind me, though!

# 23 February
## Dentist appointment

I went to the dentist today, the first time in years.

My experience with the staff was quite good. They were really friendly, prompt, and helpful for me. I showed up early and they offered me tea. And they were able to see me early as well.

As for the actual cleaning process, it was quite painful. I'm not sure if it was the hygenist being extra rough, or if it was a consequence of me not going to see the dentist in a while and not cleaning my teeth very well.

The dentist said me teeth were overall healthy, although I do need to floss or it could lead to problems. So yeah, I will do that now.

At the office I was able to make my next appointment in 6 months. My goal is to have much cleaner teeth next time!

## Green tea advocacy

I have a coworker who said they want to get into green tea, but they don't like it. They only like black tea.

I thought maybe they just hadn't had the right green tea. So the other day, I brought my Asha green tea and made it for them to try. Unfortunately, the water at our work was too hot, and the tea came out bitter, and my coworker didn't like it.

I couldn't let that stand, so I decided I had to make it correctly. The only way to do it is to let the hot water cool to the right temperature before adding the tea. I don't have a thermometer, so I kind of have to guess the right amount of time. I watch the steam coming off the water to help. I've been practicing getting the temperature right over the past few days, and I've been able to make the tea well.

Anyway, today I made it for my coworker again, this time with the correct temperature water. I thought it tasted good this time, but they still didn't like it. I guess my green tea advocacy has ended in failure.

## Weird games

I found this strange domino set at my work.

![Weird games 1](/images/blog_february/weird_games1.jpg)

They are a pink marble color with unusual dot designs. They're in a box that makes them look a trippy blue color when the lid is closed:

![Weird games 2](/images/blog_february/weird_games2.jpg)

Also, next to this was a wooden tic-tac-toe board with marble pieces:

![Weird games 3](/images/blog_february/weird_games3.jpg)

I kind of like the design of these games, but I wonder if anyone ever plays with them. It's hard to imagine someone taking time out of their day to play tic-tac-toe on a fancy board. I think they are meant to be more for decoration than actual use, which must be disappointing for the games.

# 20 February
## Doctor's appointment again

I went looking for another doctor's appointment today. I had a difficult time. I wasn't able to log-in to the online system I used last time, because I couldn't figure out my login credentials. That system didn't even work last time, because it let me make a bad appointment, so I decided to give up on it.

Then I tried other ways to find a doctor. It's hard to match all the information between reading reviews, checking if the doctor is covered by insurance, checking if the doctor is open to new patients, and actually making an appointment. It seems like all of these components are managed by multiple different sites, and there is no one place to do everything. And it seems like every individual office has its own way of booking appointments.

In the end, I figured out there are onsite doctors at my work, and I was able to book an appointment with one of them. I'm not sure if that is a good idea. Would the quality of these doctors be worse, or better...? I have no idea. But it was really easy to book an appointment, and it's convenient, so I'll take it.

## Feathers everywhere!

My down jacket has really started to go. I'll look down, and my leg will be covered in feathers. I'll clean them up, but the next time I look there will be even more.

![Jacket feathers](/images/blog_february/jacket_feathers.jpg)

It seems like my jacket has several holes in it now. I noticed one was particularly big, so I did what any sane person would do... and taped it. Not a pretty solution, but it has dramatically cut down on the leaking.

## Growing croissants

We tried out some of the frozen croissants from Milk Pail!

![Croissants 1](/images/blog_february/croissants1.jpg)

They grew a lot overnight! Too bad I don't have a before picture...


![Croissants 2](/images/blog_february/croissants2.jpg)

And they baked beautifully! I'm not usually a big fan of croissants, but I loved these. They have such a nice, buttery flavor. Maybe I had only had low quality croissants in the past. Now I will eat no other croissants than these!

# 16 February
## Green path

We went on a nice rainy day hike today, at Monte Bello. I think it's really fun to be out in the rain.

![Green path 1](/images/blog_february/green_path1.jpg)
![Green path 2](/images/blog_february/green_path2.jpg)

I love how green everything has become, since we've had several days of rain. The trees are just covered in green... Is it moss? It's so thick it looks like leaves, I wonder if it's the same thing as moss. There are so many plants in these pictures, I wish I knew what they all were.

# 15 February
## Ramen Nagi

Today we went to try Ramen Nagi!

![Ramen Nagi](/images/blog_february/ramen_nagi.jpg)

Actually, someone at work had recommended this to me as a play to try. I wanted to tell you about it, but I had forgotten its name! When you mentioned it to me, though, I remembered.

So how was the ramen? I'm not the biggest fan of ramen, but I was almost able to finish my bowl! So that means I thought it was pretty good! Ultimately, though, the heaviness of the broth was too strong for me to finish. They offer a lot of customization options, so maybe next time I will try to lower the oil?

My favorite part of the ramen here was the thin noodles. I really enjoyed them!

## Happy Valentine's Day!

I'm so happy we are each other's valentine!

![Dandelion necklace](/images/blog_february/dandelion_necklace.jpg)

I got you this necklace with a piece of a dandelion in it. I made a wish on it for you to have a wonderful life. I think the dandelion is strong enough that you could make your own wish on it, too!

My goal when looking for a present was to find you something pretty, like a necklace of some sort. In the end, this necklace isn't exactly that. It's more weird and interesting than beautiful, I guess. But that leaves open the opportunity to find you something else really stunning in the future!

## Phone case

I got a case for my new phone, now I can relax a bit while holding it:

![Phone case 1](/images/blog_february/phone_case1.jpg)
![Phone case 2](/images/blog_february/phone_case2.jpg)

I wanted to pick one that was protective but not too bulky, and has a nice look to it. I quite like this one! It has a nice grippy texture, and and adds a nice heft to the phone. Unfortunately, you can never really tell how good a case is until the critical moment when you actually drop your phone...

By the way, while looking for a phone case, I came across something called a "PopSocket"

![PopSocket](https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/field/image/2017/08/popsocket-rose-gold-01.png?itok=sXuLc3P4)
(Not my photo)

I'd actually seen one of these in real life before, but didn't know what it was. Basically, it's a little knob thing you attach to your phone to help you hold it.

It might sound dumb at first, but thinking about it more, I can totally see how this would be useful. It should give you more freedom to hold your phone in different positions without being worried about dropping it.

## Bus chat

Yesterday I was standing at the bus stop, and my regular bus showed up, but I didn't get on. I was waiting for a different bus to go somewhere else instead.

However, some of the riders on my regular bus noticed me standing there and were worried when I didn't get on, and thought I might have accidentally missed the bus. I'm surprised that I am that memorable to people -- I don't talk to anyone on the bus or anything. But today, one of the bus riders approached me, introduced himself, and told me this story.

We got to talking a bit on the bus. He is a UX (user experience) designer, just out of school, and has been here for a few months. Apparently, he is one of the first people to graduate specifically with a degree in UX. It's such a huge need in the industry now, so it's no surprise to me that degrees are being created for it.

If you don't know what UX is, it's the design everything that a user directly interacts with on a website or app. What the page layout looks like, what the colors are, where the buttons and forms are, what the text says, and more. It's a completely separate field from software engineering. It requires knowledge of design, and there is a heavy research component as well, as you have to do studies to figure out what users like.

## Mentoring a new hire

There's a new engineer joining my team at work, and I was assigned to be their mentor. I went to a short class about how to mentor effectively.

We were recommended to be aware of "imposter syndrome". It's a feeling that you're not as good as the other people around you. How do you help someone through this? I think the first thing is letting them know that it's something everyone goes through. I still have some amount of imposter syndrome, even 3+ years in. I think really, what you need to do, is keep telling yourself that it's not true. Even if you feel it to be true in heart, keep telling yourself with your brain that it's not true. Other people may seem more impressive than you, but you need to realize there is a lot of bias that goes into that perception. You only see the prepared face others show, whereas you can see all of your own internal flaws. And also, you tend to be more critical of yourself than others, maybe out politeness and distance towards them, and insecurity towards yourself.

Aside from that, I'm supposed to help my mentee get acquainted with our company culture. How there are flexible working hours, how to invite people to meetings, how to get answers to questions you have, how to set up your email, and more.

## Ice cream masters!

Today was a special day because we finished the Saddleback Brownie from Fenton's together! I really enjoyed it!

I have to wonder what was different this time versus previous times. I didn't even feel bad after finishing it! Maybe it was because we ate some lunch, but not too much?

That night was a little rough for me though. I didn't want to eat dinner, but I didn't quite feel healthy either. Maybe it would have been good to eat a small amount of vegetables...

## The Door

![The Door](/images/blog_february/the_door.jpg)

There is a strange door deep in the forest about one hour's walk away from my home village. It's not attached to any building; rather, it is built directly into a mountainside. No one in my village knows who built it, the last time it was opened, or what is on the other side. Not even the village elder has any idea why it's there -- none of our local legends say anything about it. It's just there.

This door is completely unlike any of the doors in my village. It's painted a brilliant green color and adorned with a great golden insignia; a stark contrast from the shoddy, plain wooden doors of my village. Stranger still is the door's remarkable craftmanship -- the door is completely straight and flat, and so tightly fit into its frame that nothing can be seen through its cracks.

Kids from the village sometimes go to the door to play, just because it's so weird, and stuff like that is interesting to kids. I never went with them when I was younger. But today, as usual, I don't have anything in particular to do, so I decide I might as well go take a walk to the door. There is a path to it, but it's overgrown with greenery that gets thicker and thicker as I advance along it. About halfway there, I have to start hacking away at the plants to keep going -- I anticipated this, and brought my farming hoe.

Finally, I hack aside one last mass of tree branches and emerge into a small clearing, about 10 feet in diameter. The door stands before me, its green and gold colors gleaming. I stand, staring at the door for a little while, inside thinking that I _have_ to get this door open.

I approach the door. There's a keyhole, but I don't have a key. I pull on the handle then push on it, just to check if it opens anyway, but it doesn't. I kick the door, but it doesn't open, and shows no sign of weakness. I strike at it with my hoe, but can't even make a scratch. The door looks like it is made of wood, and I have brought flint. I try to light it on fire, but no matter how I try, it doesn't catch. I try digging away at the ground beneath the door, scraping away the flowers that have grown there. But any dirt I shovel away is immediately filled in by more dirt. After an hour of digging, I seem to be making no progress whatsoever.

Finally, exhausted, I sit down on the ground to rest and think a bit. I stare at the door, grimacing, like I'm in a staring contest with it or something. And the door just stares back at me, unflinchingly.

Why do I even want to get this stupid door open? It's not curiosity. I don't really need to know what's on the other side. It's just that... well, it would be an accomplishment. It's something know one else has done, and it's something I could do, you know? But I can't even do something so simple as open a door.

Anyway, I'm not about to give up so easily. I stand up and look around the area, considering my options. There doesn't seem to be anything I could use to force the door open -- all that's here is plants. Then again, plants can be pretty strong. Growing plant roots are strong enough to break rocks, and I've even seen them upend houses in the village. Maybe if I strategically plant some seeds right at the base of the door, then water them every day, the growing plants will be strong enough to dislodge the door. Seeing no other options, I decide to give it a go.

The next day I return with seeds from a sequoia tree, and plant them at the base of the door. I return each day to take care of them, and to try to guide their growth in a direction to move the door. Days turn into weeks, weeks turn into months, months turn into years as I take care of my trees. Even the village people have started to take interest, and sometimes they come with me to help.

Slowly, slowly over the days I can the plants cause the door's perfect face start to bend. Then micro-cracks start appearing in it. Then one day I return to find the entire thing busted open. I stand frozen looking at the door for a moment, my legs shaking with anticipation, not even sure if I want to see what's inside. 

After too long, I gather my courage, approach the door, and peer inside. I see a room, neatly decorated with furniture -- couches and tables and chairs and paintings and little sculptures -- with similar bright colors and golden accents in the style of the door itself. I step inside. The room is extremely clean and shows no sign of wear, yet it also shows no signs of being lived in recently. I search around for a bit, but can find no writing or any sign of who the owner of the room might have been. Are they long dead, I wonder? I am sure the door has not been opened in many years...

Suddenly a rush of wind blows through the open door, carrying leaves and dirt inside. They land on the pristine floor, probably the first mess on it in quite some time. My first reaction is to want to clean them up, but then I think maybe it's better to leave it, and let this bizarre room return to nature.

There doesn't seem to be anything left for me to do here. I take one last look around the room, taking it all in. I grab a curious looking painting of a pond off the wall for a souvenir, then head back to my village.

## New phone

Received my new phone today! This one works!

![Phone](/images/blog_february/phone.jpg)
Yup... that's a phone.

Set up took a long time, as it usually does. It copied over all my apps fine, and some of my settings, but I spend a lot of time tweaking things. One thing I do is manually replace all of my icons to something I like more, which takes quite a while.

I can tell the phone is a more powerful and faster than my old phone in one particular way: It switches between keyboards (Japanese / English) faster.

The camera is supposedly better too, but I haven't tested it yet. You can be the judge as I post pictures on the blog!

## Asha's name

For a while I've been wondering about the meaning of Asha's name.

I was mentioned Asha to my coworker today, and she thought it was an Indian name (she's Indian herself). She said it means hope, and it's a kind of common, cliched name that non-Indians might choose if they want to sound Indian, but don't want to pick something that's too hard to pronounce in English.

Could this be the meaning of Asha's name? I never thought of them as a primarily Indian tea place, but I guess they do have Indian tea there.

Anyway, I went to the "About" section on Asha's website to check, and actually it says this:

"'Asha', after all, is Taiwanese for 'someone that enjoys life', and our hope is that drinking Asha tea will remind you of the things you enjoy about life."

I think that's nice! I drink a lot of tea by myself these days, but I remember that for me, the true spirit of tea is sharing it with someone. That's how I would like to enjoy life with tea.

# 6 February
## Tea sample

I ordered my usual sencha and assam tea from Asha, and they also sent me a sample of a tea called Golden Lily!

![Golden Lily 1](/images/blog_february/golden_lily1.jpg)
![Golden Lily 2](/images/blog_february/golden_lily2.jpg)

I doubt this is actually the case, but I want to believe that they noticed I always order the same two teas, so they sent me another tea to broaden my horizons.

Anyway, according to the package: "Golden Lily is a tea cultivar whose soft, creamy mouthfeel and flavor has earned it the name of 'milk oolong.'"

Does it actually have a creamy mouthfeel? I wonder. I tried it out, following their instructions, but it came out pretty light, and tasted fairly similar to water. I think next time I have to try to steep it more.

## The number of emoji

Today they announced the new emoji being added to the emoji standard for 2019. They're adding 230 this year. Isn't it a bit much...? It's easy for them to approve new emoji, but it adds a lot of work for the people who have to implement them. Also it makes it that much harder to search through them.

This brings the total amount of emoji to 3,053. That's more than the amount of kanji in WaniKani! Now all we need is a grammar and we can make an entire language out of emoji!

...Actually though, for serious, the comparison between emoji and kanji highlights why people primarily use words for communication rather than pictures. Eventually it becomes infeasible to represent every possible concept with simple pictures. To represent more complicated concepts it makes more sense to just combine simple concepts together -- i.e., stick multiple characters together to form words.

## Lunar New Year celebration at work

Today they had a small Lunar New Year celebration during lunchtime at work. There were decorations, various games and activities, and themed food.

First, they gave us this red envelope and coin:

![Red envelope](/images/blog_february/red_envelope.jpg)
![Lunar coin](/images/blog_february/lunar_coin.jpg)

I didn't do many of the activities, but one I did do was drawing this character. They said it brings good fortune:

![fuku](/images/blog_february/fuku.jpg)

I didn't do a very good job. Though in my defense, they didn't give us any instructions. I wish I could learn the proper technique.

## Character profile: Lee

Here's a character profile for Lee, the character from _Kowagarijanai Chronicles_.

**Full name**: Lee Jae-Yoon

**Age**: 22 years old.

**Physical description**: Average height. Lean and muscular. Has long black hair that he often keeps in a rough ponytail of sorts. Currently his wardrobe consists of mostly pirate clothes, since he was traveling with ghost pirates on his previous adventure.

**Personality**: Chill and good-natured, makes friends easily. He's great at listening to people, and reading into them. Doesn't usually talk about himself, unless asked.

**Biography**: He doesn't have a particular profession, but describes himself as a "traveler", and gets into various adventures.

Lee was born into poverty and ran away from home at the age of 10 to seek greater things. He has been wandering the world ever since, and has never returned home. To name but a few of his adventures, he has visited the underworld, had tea with a god, traveled through time, died and got revived by a sacrifice from a phoenix, got stranded on a deserted island, and accidentally married (then quickly divorced) a princess. He has saved the world a few times, taken down a couple of evil empires, and more.

**Motivation for joining Alice's guild**: While sailing across the ocean, he saw Yggdrasil The World Tree on the horizon and couldn't pass up the chance for a new adventure. He joined Alice's guild because she needed someone to take the role of a defender, and he had never done that before, and thought it would be interesting.

**Things he likes**: Hearing the stories of other adventurers, and sharing his own.

**Things he worries about**: What compels him to wander the world so restlessly? Someone close to him once accused him of running away from his past. And, although he would never admit it to himself, perhaps he is searching for connection and love.

**People he is close to**: He has had many traveling companions over the course of his life that he became close to. However, he inevitably parted ways with each one, and moved on to the next adventure.

**Fighting style**: Lee is probably one of the strongest sword fighters in the entire world. However, during this current adventure, Lee takes up the role of defender instead, something he does not have much experience in. He stands with Alice on the frontlines of battles, using his massive shield to protect his allies from attack, and trying to draw the attention of enemies.

## Things that work, things that don't work (part 2)

Today I visited the AT&T store to get my new phone checked out. I was pretty sure that the phone itself was broken and there was nothing they could do to help. But I had to go for the due dilligence.

...And yeah, when I went there, they eventually concluded that the phone was faulty.

So then, when I got home, I contacted Google support again and requested to exchange the phone. It was a bit of a struggle. You really have to convince them that you have tried every possible thing before they let you do an exchange.

So that's done now. Hopefully the new phone arrives soon, but they didn't send me a tracking number and I have no idea how long it will take. I guess I just gotta wait.

Anyway, sorry the blog posts for the past two days have just been this long, negative story. The title refers to the fact that I was impressed by some things that worked really well, and frustrated by some things that didn't work. Ordering the phone was so easy, setting it up was so easy... but then because it didn't work, I had to go through a massive struggle of customer support and wasted time. By the end of this, I think I had to talk to 7 different customer service agents, and also had to involve my dad.

In hindsight, I think I should have just made a hard request to return the phone on the first day, and to not take no for an answer.

# 1 February
## Things that work, things that don't work (part 1)

So I ordered a phone today. The process was quick and easy. I ordered it while riding the bus to work, and it arrived later that afternoon. But when I moved my SIM card to the new phone, it couldn't be recognized. Uh oh.

I tried resetting the phone, taking the card in and out again, cleaning the card and card slot... but nothing worked.

Then I contacted Google customer support. I liked their customer support because you could do text chat instead of phone. They had me try a few things, but none of it worked. Then they told me to contact my carrier, AT&T. I was frustrated by this because it was clear something had to be wrong with the phone, not my service. The SIM card worked in my old phone, so the only thing that could be wrong was the new phone. But anyway, I went ahead and contacted AT&T.

That turned out to be quite a struggle. They also have a text chat support system... except you're not allowed to use it unless you log-in to your account. The problem was, I don't own the account -- my dad does. So I couldn't use the text chat system. I had to call them.

And that was a struggle, too. For one, my phone would randomly hang up sometimes when attempting to call them. I don't know why, because nothing like this ever happens when I call other people. But eventually I got through to them, then they put me on hold and I had to listen to some ads for a while. Then when I got to talk to someone, they couldn't help me unless I knew my account passcode. So I had to give up and call my dad to get that information. Then I called them back and they still couldn't come up with a solution for me. And so I had to go visit the store the next day...

## Kingdom Hearts III

My sister recently texted me about a game that just released called Kingdom Hearts III. It was a bit of a surprise because I don't usually get texts from my sister! But she is a big fan of the series, so she is excited about this new release. After all, Kingdom Hearts II came out in 2005, 14 years ago... that's about half of my sister's life!

Anyway, to give more context, this is a kind of a bizarre game series which is a crossover between various Disney movies, Final Fantasy, and original characters as well. Just look at these characters hanging out together:

![Kingdom Hearts III](/images/blog_january/kingdom_hearts_iii.jpg)

I've never been a huge fan of the series myself, but part of me wants to play it to have something to connect with my sister over, since I don't talk to her very much these days.
