## Lost earbuds

A great tragedy today... I lost the wireless earbuds my dad just gave me!! Don't tell him, or he'll go buy me some new ones.

I don't know what happened. I remember taking them out on the bus but not putting them in my ears, and just letting them sit on my backpack. I don't remember what I did with them after that. Then, the moment I got off the bus, I noticed I hadn't put them in my backpack like I usually do, and I couldn't find them.

There's only two possible things that could have happened:

1. I left them on the bus
2. I dropped them within seconds of getting off the bus

My company has a pretty good system for finding items lost on buses. You report it to the transportation team, and then at a certain time each day they take all the requests from people for that day and go searching the buses. Unfortunately, they weren't able to find my earbuds.

Another possibility is another pasenger on the bus found them, picked them up, and turned them into a building. There is a master log of all turned-in items you can check online, but my earbuds weren't there.

So the only other possibility I can think of is that I dropped right as I was getting off the bus. However, I didn't think of this possibility until hours later. I returned to the bus stop to search the ground, but I couldn't find them.

Now I'm really disappointed with myself. I think I will buy some replacement ones though, since I was getting used to their benefits.

## The end of Inbox

I still use the alternative site for Gmail called Inbox. It looks different from standard Gmail.

Here's Inbox:

And here's Gmail:

(In these shots, I whited out some personal details)

Maybe you can see, the biggest difference between the two is the way they handle "reminders". In Inbox, they appear in the normal email list, and they can be snoozed like ordinary mail (dismissed until a time that you set, at which point they re-appear with a notification). Gmail doesn't have reminders like this, instead it has a "My Tasks" sidebar, but the reminders can't be snoozed and don't come with notifications.

Anyway, today I logged into Inbox and received a notification that it's going away and won't be available after March. I've known about this for a while, but the time has finally come.

I guess I am one of the last hold-outs using this very unpopular service. I just like the reminders feature a lot. It is so quick and easy to use, and I rely on it to remember all sorts of minor things, like when you ask me to wash your clothes for you.

I'm sad it's going away, but that is the way of things. Onwards to Gmail!

## Plaza del Sol

Today we visited downtown Sunnyvale with an old friend of ours. I'd been there briefly before but never had a chance to look around.

The main downtown street seems very small, even compared to Mountain View's. However, there is a nice plaza area we went to called Plaza Del Sol. It had some interesting designs on it, like one part that was like a maze, and another part that looked like a clock. I wish I had taken pictures, but I didn't!

There were also cool fruit statues, and something called a "Ball Tower". When the clock hits a certain time, balls roll through a contraption and hit chimes, creating music. We heard it but didn't see it!

Downtown Sunnyvale is a place I want to go back to and explore some more. I've lived here 3 years and haven't really been there, isn't that crazy? I want to see if there are more interesting restaurants and things there!

## New Year's goals

It's a new year and here are my goals for the year!

- Learn 1000 more kanji in WaniKani! (currently I am at 241)
- Set up regular doctor's appointments, and go to one!
- Set up regular dentist's appointments, and go to one!

I think that's about it. Otherwise, I want to keep on enjoying every day to the fullest! And I want to keep on loving you as much as I can! They say that love fades over time (is it because people take each other for granted?), but that's not going to happen for me! I will keep appreciating you with all my heart! This year, and every year.
