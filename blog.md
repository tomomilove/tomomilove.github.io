## Fredericka the Great

I've started thinking of a new story called _Fredericka the Great_. I'm not entirely sure what I will do with the story, but for now I have written the first chapter which can be thought of as a "pilot chapter" of sorts. [Here](/fredericka_the_great/) it is, let me know what you think.

## Inspiring quote

I came across this quote and really liked it, so I wanted to share it with you:

"I beg you, to have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and to try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language." -- Rainer Maria Rilke, _Letters to a Young Poet_

Recently I have been worrying over things like finding a good job, but reading quotes like this gives me peace. To have patience with the unresolved things... it's a state-of-mind that I had once believed in, but have perhaps forgotten recently. To embrace the challenge, like reading a foreign language, is something I know I can enjoy. I hope to maintain that mindset.

The next chapter of Kowagarijani Chronicles is here! Last time, the party all got separated and lost in the jungle, though Alice managed to meet up with Kaori. See what adventures await them in [chapter 44](/story#４４章)! English version [here](/english_story#chapter-44).

## Extra story

Hey, check yesterday's post! I finally added a new chapter of Kowagarijanai Chronicles!

Today, I wanted to post an extra story I wrote, detailing Yamamoto's backstory. It explains why Yamamoto can see visions of the future. This has actually been written for a long time, I just never had the opportunity to post it.

This story is quite long and written with more detail than a typical chapter, so it's only in English, there is no Japanese version. Anyway, it has its own webpage, [here](/extra_story).

Sorry if it's kind of long, only read it if you have some free time!

## Chapter 43

The next chapter of Kowagarijanai Chronicles is [here](/story#４３章)! English version [here](/english_story#chapter-43).

Here's a recap in case you forgot what has happened so far:

Alice, Tanaka, John, Lee, Yamamoto, and Yamamoto's apprentice Kaori set off to explore a jungle. After traveling for some time, Alice got into a disagreement with Yamamoto about whether or not they should continue further in. At which point, Yamamoto revealed that she sometimes receives visions of the future, and she had one in which the party encountered a powerful dragon that killed all of them. Using this knowledge, the party planned a surprise attack on that dragon. However, it ended in failure, when the dragon stirred the wind up into a tornado that sent each member of the party flying in different directions.
