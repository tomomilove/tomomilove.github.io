# 4 November (bonus)
## Another story chapter!

Wow, two blog posts in one day? I'm adding another chapter of the story, since the chapter posted on 2 November was pretty short. As always, there's a [Japanese version](/story#２２章) and an [English version](/english_story#chapter-22).

## Beautiful Fall day

Many leaves have fallen from the trees around here, covering the ground. They don't bother to clean them up, but I like it this way. It's fun to stomp around in the leaves!

It was sunny, but the air was cool. There are plenty of reasons why Fall is my favorite season!

## Party at Mamacitas

I went to Mamacitas Tacos today and discovered they have a snazzy new truck. Completely with some pretty fancy light rimming!

They seem to be pretty proud of their orange sauce as well:

I don't blame them, it's pretty good!

I think today they were having some kind of celebration for the new truck, because this time they had free horchata, pineapple, watermelon, and cake for everyone to eat. I guess they must be doing pretty well!

## Neat mnemonics

You were interested in some of the kanji and vocabular mnemonics in learn, so I've tried to recall some interesting ones for you. These are all from memory, so let's see if these mnemonics work!

六. Reading: ろく. Meaning: 6. This is made up of the radicals they call lid and fins. They say to imagine a monster with fins for its legs and a fan for its head running around, crazy, tearing everything up. Also, the location it is running around is hell, and everything is burning. Suddenly, it runs up to you, then lowers its head to show you its pan. On the pan, you can see the numbers written: 666, the sign of the devil! (That’s how you remember six). Then it gets out a guitar and starts playing some rock and roll, because rock and roll is associated with the devil. That’s how you remember ろく, you think of rock.

出す. Reading だす. Meaning: To take out. This is the exit kanji with す on the end. Imagine Sue (す) in a box, and you have to take her out. Also your dad (だ) is in the box too. What are you doing in the box, Dad?

出る. Reading でる. Meaning: To exit. This is the exit kanji with る on the end. る  as in room, imagine you need to exit a room, and fast. Why? Because there is a dead person (で) in this room! You feel you need to exit out of there fast… because you’re scared? (Or because you murdered them??)

八日. Reading ようか. Meaning: Eighth day, or eight days. Imagine you have a car (か) that runs on yogurt (よう). Not only that, you have to refill it about every 8 days. Isn’t that so inconvenient, 8 days? If it was 7 days, you could refill it the same time every week. But no, it has to be 8, forcing you to change your schedule all the time!

一日. Reading ついたち. Meaning: First day. One the first day of dating someone, you only get two (つい) touches (たち). Just two. You can hug them and give them a high five or something. Maybe you’ll go further on the second day?

白. Reading はく. Meaning: White. Imagine two teams: the white team and the black team, in a competition to see how can hack (はく) the iPhone first. The white team is clad all in white from head to toe, they’re in a pristine white room, and working furiously on a shiny white iPhone. Suddenly, they hold it up in victory! They did it! The white team wins!

田. Reading た. Meaning: Rice paddy. Imagine standing in the middle of a rice paddy. You bend down to take a closer look at one of the plants… and you discover it’s actually sprouting miniature tacos (た)! 

文. Reading ぶん or もん. Meaning: Writing. They say this comes from the doll radical. Imagine one of your dolls come to life while you’re not around and starts writing you notes demanding pork buns (ぶん). You find this rather creepy, both that it can write and the fact that it’s demanding buns. Why do you need buns? You’re just a doll after all. And a creepy one. Then it retorts (in writing): I’m not monster (もん)! Treat me with some respect!

右. Reading みぎ. Meaning: Right. They say this is made up of the mouth radical and the narwhal radical (just go with it, it’s narwhal because it looks like the ナ (na) character). Imagine a group of people on the political right trying to speak (using their mouths 口) on behalf of the narwhals. Can these people really represent the narwhals? And what are they demanding? Well, since they’re on the right, they’re really into military spending, and they’re demanding that we provide MiG fighter jets (みぎ) for them. Is that really what the narwhals need...?

左. Reading ひだり. Meaning: Left. This is made up of the narwhal and the construction radicals. Imagine a group of people on the political left also trying to represent the narwhals. But these people on the left think the solution is to build houses for them (that’s where the construction radical comes in). You travel to the arctic waters where the narwhals live, and you find a huge group of volunteers (college students and other people clearly on the left), building houses for the narwhals. You approach the group, and they all greet you by saying “Hidari!” You’re not quite sure what they mean. Are they saying “Hi dearie!” or something else? Is this some new young people slang you don’t know about?
