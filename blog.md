## User CSS

At some point earlier I mentioned that the code for a website is generally broken into 3 components:
- _HTML_, which describes the structure and layout of the site (what content is located where)
- _CSS_, which describes the colors of the page (colors and fonts)
- _Javascript_, which handles logic from actions (e.g. causing something to occur when clicking a button)

Since the code for a website is running on your computer, you can replace them with whatever you want! It's common for people to replace the CSS of a site with their own CSS, thereby creating a custom theme for the site!

For a while I've been using a dark theme for WaniKani that someone else made a while ago. But recently WaniKani has been making some changes to the structure of the site, causing parts of theme to break. Unfortunately, the original creator of the dark theme is no longer interested in maintaining it. So I've spent the past couple of days making the fixes myself! It's not too difficult -- you just have to inspect the site to figure out what the names of the components are, then you specify what their colors should be. It's actually kind of fun!

Here's what it looks like now, basically I had to make some fixes in the top bar area, since that's what changed mostly:

## Hurt finger

This may sound like a simple thing, but I have a serious problem!

There's a loose thread in a pocket of one of my pants. I seriously can't help but fidget with it. And I do it so much that two things happen: 1) The tip of my finger actually becomes hurt from rubbing the string too much, and 2) my finger muscles actually become sore and tired from fidgeting too much.

This was a problem a while ago, so naturally I trimmed the loose string. But it came back! And I hurt my finger again over the past couple of days. So today I trimmed the string once more. If it returns again though, I guess I have no choice except to be really strong with my self-discipline? I think it's crazy that my body would naturally want to do this even to the point of hurting itself...

## Trophy

My product area at work held an awards thing. You could nominate people in the product area for exceptional work in various categories. I actually don't even know what the categories were, I didn't pay much attention because I don't care so much about awards, but someone nominated my subteam and we won an award!

![Trophy](/images/blog_may/trophy.jpg)

In the award explanation they called out one of the projects I worked on!

To be honest though, a trophy doesn't mean much to me. I don't feel much pride to be acknowledged by the higher-ups in my organization. However, I think I would like it if I got more recognition from my immediate teammates. If I felt that my coworkers cared about my work, I think I would feel more motivated.

## Stickers!

I heard a story from one of my coworkers that she accidentally took someone else's laptop on accident... lots of people have the same model so it's easy to get them confused.

So I decided to get a sticker for my laptop to help distinguish it! On my previous laptop I had a sticker about my work company, but actually, that's not recommended, because if you work out in public then people will you know are working for the company. So I decided to get a WaniKani sticker!

![Wanikani sticker 1](/images/blog_may/wanikani_sticker1.jpg)

Cool, right?

Actually, you have to order them in a pack, so I got a whole bunch...

![Wanikani sticker 2](/images/blog_may/wanikani_sticker2.jpg)

What should I do with the others, though?

## Work celebrations

Someone at my team at work decided to have monthly celebrations to celebrate the birthdays of all people on the team in that month. Well, they are very small celebrations, because they happen every month, but at least there is cake!

![Work cake](/images/blog_may/work_cake.jpg)
(Sorry for the upside down photo, it says "It's celebration time!")

It's not much, but I feel like my team is becoming a little more friendly with each other recently!

## Rain walk

Today we had a fun day! We walked to the park nearby, and then you told me a story in Japanese. It was about a person who saved a turtle, then as a reward was invited to an underwater kingdom, had fun in different season rooms, and then suddenly discovered a lot of time had passed. I liked the story but I don't remember the name of the main character unfortunately! Maybe one day I'll tell the story to someone else, but mess up the character's name and get some details wrong... I guess that's why folk tales are always changing over time!

After the park walked home and it started raining pretty hard, but we only had a small umbrella! That's okay though, I think being out in the rain is enjoyable, and it was fun to walk with you!

## 私はイチゴ王子です。

Today we made this sand art kit my sister gave me!

![Sunae](/images/blog_may/sunae.jpg)

I thought it was fun! And not too hard. It's the kind of craft you can just zone out while doing. Those are the best crafts, I think! The result is nice too!

I wonder what I should do with them...? They are too nice to throw away, but I don't have a great place to put them. Would you like to keep yours, or both of them?

Also, I want to be a Strawberry Prince! That sounds like a good life!

## Mail shocker!

So after failing to send the mother's day present to my mom last weekend, I tried again today. I made the trip to main campus of my work to use the mail machine...

...and when I got there, I discovered they had discontinued the machine! Nooo! 

They recommended buying postage online and printing it out as a replacement for the machine. I could do that, but the problem was, I didn't have any way of figuring out how heavy my package was without the machine. I'm not aware of any other scales at work to use...

So anyway, I guess I'll send it at the downtown post office tomorrow! I'll have to get there before 2:00 this time.

## Mauve

Do you know what the color mauve looks like?

![Mauve 1](https://www.color-hex.com/palettes/45821.png)

![Mauve 2](https://images.reference.com/reference-production-images/question/aq/color-mauve-look-like_dbcb2707b18a43ef.jpg?width=760&height=411&fit=crop)

(Not my photos)

At my work, sometimes teams can declare emergency situations called "code yellow" or "code red" depending on the severity. It means everyone needs to stop working on their current projects and instead work on the emergency situation.

Anyway, my team recently declared a "code mauve", where only a few people had to work on it, and I was one of them.

Mainly, I'm just wondering what the significance of the color choice was! When I first heard it, I thought maybe it meant more severe than yellow but less severe than red. However, mauve isn't really that color, I guess that would have been "code orange". So I'm not sure what the mauve is meant to signify...

## Mark Twain learning a language

Someone on the WaniKani forums linked [this piece of writing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~gback/awfgrmlg.html) by Mark Twain called _The Awful German Language_, describing his struggles to learn German. I thought it was pretty funny and relatable with my experience learning Japanese!

It's a pretty long piece, so I won't expect you to read it all, but I'll highlight this section I found funny, which describes difficulty from verbs coming at the ends of the sentences, and difficulties with lack of word breaks. It's something I've struggled with in Japanese as well!

"An average sentence, in a German newspaper, is a sublime and impressive curiosity; it occupies a quarter of a column; it contains all the ten parts of speech -- not in regular order, but mixed; it is built mainly of compound words constructed by the writer on the spot, and not to be found in any dictionary -- six or seven words compacted into one, without joint or seam -- that is, without hyphens; it treats of fourteen or fifteen different subjects [...] -- **after which comes the VERB**, and you find out for the first time what the man has been talking about [...] German books are easy enough to read when you hold them before the looking-glass or stand on your head -- so as to reverse the construction [...]

"Now here is a sentence from a popular and excellent German novel -- which a slight parenthesis in it. I will make a perfectly literal translation, and throw in the parenthesis-marks and some hyphens for the assistance of the reader -- though in the original there are no parenthesis-marks or hyphens, and the reader is left to flounder through to the remote verb the best way he can:

"But when he, upon the street, the (in-satin-and-silk-covered-now-very-unconstrained-after-the-newest-fashioned-dressed) government counselor's wife **met**," etc., etc. [1]

"1. Wenn er aber auf der Strasse der in Sammt und Seide gehüllten jetzt sehr ungenirt nach der neusten Mode gekleideten Regierungsräthin begegnet."

"That is from _The Old Mamselle's Secret_, by Mrs. Marlitt. And that sentence is constructed upon the most approved German model. You observe how far that verb is from the reader's base of operations; well, in a German newspaper they put their verb away over on the next page; and I have heard that sometimes after stringing along the exciting preliminaries and parentheses for a column or two, they get in a hurry and have to go to press without getting to the verb at all. Of course, then, the reader is left in a very exhausted and ignorant state."

## You don't realize how much you'll miss something until it's gone...

It's really starting to hit me that Milk Pail is closing. Recently, I have been going there often, with increasing frequency, to pick up different snacks. It's exactly the same thing I did when I was about to leave Berkeley, and I started to go to Asha with increasing frequency. Because, if I keep going there more and more, it will never go away, right? Unfortunately, that's not how it works, and time marches on ceaselessly...

Well, enough of that! I got this interesting snack there today:

![Gaufres 1](/images/blog_may/gaufres1.jpg)

They're waffle cookies, earl grey flavor! It sounded interesting, so I figured I might as well try it!

![Gaufres 2](/images/blog_may/gaufres2.jpg)

Here's a look at the cookie. I was surprised to see actual tea leaves stuck in it.

It was pretty good! It reminded me very much of eating earl grey ice cream at Ici together with its cone. I saved some for you, so you should try it and let me know what you think!

## Intern days

My intern started recently. Actually his first day was last week, but he was in orientation mostly. Today was his first actual day!

I was pretty impressed with how quickly he was able to get things working. He had some code ready to submit on the first day already!

Talking to him a little bit, he seems to have plans to go to grad school. But he's not entirely sure, and maybe will end up working in the industry instead. In that way, he reminds me of myself at that age, unsure what to do. Hopefully the internship will provide some clarity to him! I think it would have for me, if I had done one...

## Unfinished model

I didn't have much to do today, so I thought I'd try to make the bicycle model our friends gave me a while back.

![Bicycle model 1](/images/blog_may/bicycle_model1.jpg)
![Bicycle model 2](/images/blog_may/bicycle_model2.jpg)

Unfortunately it didn't go so well! I only got so far before pieces started breaking. The metal gets really thin at points! I was getting a little frustrated too, and maybe not in the best mood for this sort of thing. In the end, I got this far:

![Bicycle model 3](/images/blog_may/bicycle_model3.jpg)

I may continue on another day. Maybe it would be better to build a little at a time...?

## Late mothers' day present

I went downtown today to get a present for my mom. Do you remember, last week I mentioned there was an event where they were selling art downtown? I should have gotten something then! They probably deliberately set it up for mothers' day, too, but I didn't notice at the time.

Anyway, today I got this dog jigsaw puzzle.

![Dog puzzle](/images/blog_may/dog_puzzle.jpg)

I think my mom would like it!

All the dogs on here are mixed breeds, and have funny names written next to them.

My plan was to mail it from the downtown post office immediately. However, I didn't make it, because it closed much earlier than I expected! It closed at 2:00. The post office never fails to surprise me with how much it is closed!

Anyway, now I'm not sure how I'm going to send it. I gues I have to go during work, because post office isn't open on Sunday.

## Monoliths

I found this artwork near my work:

![Monoliths 1](/images/blog_may/monoliths1.jpg)
![Monoliths 2](/images/blog_may/monoliths2.jpg)
![Monoliths 3](/images/blog_may/monoliths3.jpg)

As you can see, they are large rocks split down the middle and with binary code inside. I kind of like these actually! I like the contrast between the rough, natural surface of the rocks and the clean cut interior, and the trees complement the scene well! It's not overdone either; it's minimalist in a nice way. I think the whole thing just gives off a deeply mysterious impression, which I find sparks my imagination!

## Thoughts after playing Pokemon for a few days

I have to say, this isn't exactly the best game for practicing kanji! There is katakana everywhere, and tons of borrowed English words. I wonder, is this how people normally speak and write? Or is it just because the game is aimed at kids? On the plus side, I have gotten much faster at reading katakana!

One aspect of the game that has been difficult for me is autoscrolling text. Outside of battle the text is fine, but during battle the text automatically advances, and it's too fast for me to read a lot of the time! But maybe it will teach me to read more quickly.

This game has an interesting sidequest where you can participate in "Pokewood", Pokemon's version of Hollywood, to make movies. It's pretty elaborate, actually. You do a fight with a green screen background, and during the fight, you have to fulfill certain conditions to follow the movie script. You also have to choose the correct line to speak at certain points. Afterwards, you can go watch the movie with all the special effects filled in! It's a pretty fun mode, but the problem is, because they give you the instructions during battle, it autoscrolls, and it is too difficult follow. So I end up giving bad answers and creating failure movies!

By the way, I got this pokemon called ヨーテリー:

![Yoterrie](https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/7/7e/506Lillipup.png/600px-506Lillipup.png)

I named mine ミニク. It looks just like her, right?

## I like cucumbers and I like tea, but this is going a bit far

![Cucumber tea](/images/blog_may/cucumber_tea1.jpg)

So they had this new tea at work...

I've made it no secret that I dislike teas with bizarre things added to it, such as fruit. Then I saw this _cucumber_ tea. It sounded so awful I had to try it. But first, let's read the back of the box:

![Cucumber tea back of the box](/images/blog_may/cucumber_tea2.jpg)

...It's a bit dramatic. I'm not actually sure what it means by "speed-of-sound steam trains". Are there steam trains that go that fast...? I'm pretty sure not...?

Anyway, I tried the tea, and... it basically tasted like nothing. It's hard to describe, but the tea felt like it had scent, but no flavor. And it was a very generic kind of scent. I didn't really notice cucumber.

Conclusion: The tea wasn't as bad as I was expecting, but it just felt kind of pointless to me.

## Bus scare

I was riding the bus home and there was a smell of fuel. The driver stopped the bus and examined it, and it turned out there was some leaking fuel. They couldn't determine the cause but guessed the tank was overfilled or something. So they continued on the bus route.

I got scared though. Is leaking fuel safe? Could the bus, like, suddenly explode or something? I'm not sure how this works, but I imagined the worst. So I got off the bus early and walked the rest of the way home.

It wasn't too bad of a decision! I got to enjoy the sunshine on the way back. Actually, my doctor had recommended getting off the bus early and walking home as a way to get exercise. Also, I stopped by a restaurant on the way home to get dinner, a Mexican restaurant called Rincon Sabroso. It's a good place I used to go to often, but I hadn't been to recently due to it being a bit far.

## Returning to ポケットモンスターホワイト２

I returned to my playthrough of the Pokemon game you gave me, with kanji turned on this time! I actually decided to start from the beginning again, to reread the intro. And I gotta say, it was like 100x easier to read this time! This made me feel really happy, because I can tell I've made a lot of progress since I last tried to play this game. I can recognize a lot more vocab, and the various speech patterns of the different characters make a lot more sense to me now.

In a few minutes I already surpassed how far I had made it the last time. I'm really looking forward to continuing this!

## Downtown event

I ran downtown today, and the streets were closed to cars because there happened to be an event going on! I think it was called "A la carte and art". That makes it sound fancier than it is though. They just had various people selling their art goods, some food, and some music as well.

There were a lot of pretty things you could buy! I thought to myself, "I could spend my peer bonus on something here!", but I didn't. Nothing in particular stood out, and even with some free money to spend, I didn't want to make an impulse purchase.

It's really nice to have the street closed anyway, you can walk anywhere without a care in the world! You know, I think they should just always keep it closed! Turn the downtown into a giant plaza. There's no good reason cars have to go through it, right? That, or at least close it on the weekends! It would be nice!

# 3 May
## 世界樹の迷宮の終わりです

So I finally finished 世界樹の迷宮X, the game that Kowagarijanai Chronicles is based on!

Not sure if you've been keeping track, but I've been playing this game since August. It took me about 240 hours of playtime to beat. There's actually even more to do in the game after the ending, including an extra hard dungeon and some extra hard bosses, but I think I'm ready to move on from it now, even though I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Also, rest assured, the story Kowajarijani Chronicles will continue! Although it is pretty far away from the ending. Also, I'm planning to deviate from the game's plot significantly.

I'm thinking about what game I'd like to play in Japanese next. I have one in mind, but I think I'm going to wait until I've learned some more kanji and vocab first. In the meantime, I may return to the Pokemon game you gave me.

## Humanoid crane

I still receive emails about meetings for our old origami club. About a month ago, I received one that said they were going to make a humanoid crane. I had always wanted to build this model actually, but never thought I could find the diagrams. However, the email mentioned the original artist's name, Sasade Shinji, so I decided to go look for them.

I was able to find some low quality ones online! So I went to fold the humanoid crane! Here is what it is supposed to look like (photo not mine):

![Pro humanoid crane](https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/5760742b14fb77b7cfb00df078925836/5D770000/t51.2885-15/e35/21148167_139653569974182_7325957890387214336_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&se=8&ig_cache_key=MTU5MzYxMzUwMTU1NzIyMjk2OQ%3D%3D.2)

And here's mine:

![Humanoid crane](/images/blog_may/humanoid_crane.jpg)

It turned out all right! My only regret was not using larger paper. It was a fun build though!

## Performance rating

I received my semi-annual performance rating today. The rating I got was "exceeds expectations". Contrary to its name, this is actual the normal expected rating, because everyone is expected to exceed their role.

This is better than I had done the past two times though, so I guess it's a personal improvement. I still feel infinitely far away from a promotion though, unfortunately.

I think my primary feedback was that I need to deliver more impactful results. Ah, it's so difficult...
