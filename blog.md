## WaniKani

Yesterday I was complaining about not learning kanji very well, so today I went looking for some options. One thing I saw recommended online was a site called WaniKani. I tried it out for a bit, and it's kind of like Duolingo. However, it specifically focuses on teaching kanji and vocabulary. One thing I didn't like about Duolingo was how it shied away from exposing you to kanji. Maybe there is more kanji later along in Duolingo, but it was taking a while to get there.

These various education apps usually each have their own teaching gimmick, and WaniKani is no exception. Something is does differently is how it gives you repeated tests, and forcibly spreads them apart. After completing a section, you're actually not allowed to do anything else for a while (up to several hours), and then you come back and repeat it. They claim this helps memory retention.

I think I'll stick with WaniKani for a while and see how it goes. After the first few sections (which I think they said takes around 1 month), you have to pay to continue, and it's not super cheap. However, if it can teach me ~2000 kanji (as it claims), I think the price is worth it.

## Filling out the ジョー書

I spent a long time today adding words to my Japanese dictionary.

It's quite a laborious process. As I play through 世界樹の迷宮X, I look up the words I come across on my phone, but I don't add them to my dictionary immediately. That would be too slow, and would break up the gameplay so much that it wouldn't be fun. Instead, I merely add the word to a note on my phone. Then, at some later point in time, I go over all those words again and write them in my dictionary. I take the time to look up the radicals and check the stroke order, hoping this will help me learn them, so this part takes a long time.

I'm not sure if this is a very effective way to learn. There are so many words, and not a lot of repetition, and as a result many words I look up just go in one side of my brain and out the other. I'm definitely learning some things, especially the words that are repeatedly used. But I don't think I'm learning as well as if I were to take a dedicated course of study.

I've repeatedly considered getting myself a textbook, but I know it wouldn't be as fun as playing a game, so I wonder if I could motivate myself to get through it. Perhaps I could do both, but I'm not sure if I have enough free time for that. Still, it's worth considering.

## Flower identification

I am always interested to know about the kinds of flowers I see. Today I saw these that were pretty nice:

![Penstemon 1](/images/blog_october/penstemon1.jpg)
![Penstemon 2](/images/blog_october/penstemon2.jpg)

I wanted to know what they were, then I remembered there is a feature on my phone that can attempt to identify plants based on photos. So I tried it with a few photos. It had a few suggestions, but mostly seems to identify them as beardtoungues, or [_penstemon_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penstemon).

Looking at other pictures of _penstemon_, it looks like these flowers could be that, though I'm not entirely sure. However, Wikipedia notes that _penstemon_ is "a large genus of roughly 250 species", so it's hard to know for sure.

Here are some other pictures of _penstemon_ from around the net. What do you think, is this the right one?

![Close-up penstemon](https://cdn.webvanta.com/000000/51/74/slider_detail/uploads/plant/1454697321-4252c077288ab5fc9/Penstemon%20Rich%20Ruby%20Secret%20Garden%20Growers.jpg)

![Mid penstemon](https://www.connonnurseries.com/_ccLib/image/plants/DETA-4632.jpg)

![Penstemon field](https://cdn-us-ec.yottaa.net/56dee4822bb0ac27b5000832/www.highcountrygardens.com/v~4b.14a/media/catalog/product/cache/3/image/500x/cdd56dd0d7347dc27aa421c918b212c4/p/e/penstemon_virens_75795-3_1.jpg?yocs=z_&yoloc=us)

According to Wikipedia, they are called _penstemon_ due to their 5 ("penta") stamen. I can't tell whether that's the case in my own pictures, maybe I can go back and check that!

## Unpopular park

Where would I go at work if I wanted to sit by myself with no one else around for a little bit?

How about this park right in the middle of the campus?

![Unpopular park](/images/blog_october/unpopular_park.jpg)

I never see anyone here. I think if you look at the park, you can see why. There are all these benches and trees, but most of the benches aren't under the trees, and instead are randomly out in the open in the sun. That's not very inviting. Then, it might be nice if you could sit under the trees, but the ground around them is not comfortable for sitting. The rest of the ground being gravel isn't very inviting either.

I wish they had put some more thought into this area so it would be a nice place to hang out! As it is, though, at least it's a place to sit if I don't want to be bothered by anyone.

## Residency review

Do you remember how when I first started working, I was in an educational "residency" program? Well, these days, I help support that program. I am assigned a group of people in this program to review their project.

Today, I had to review their project design doc. In a design doc, they are supposed to explain what problem they are trying to solve and what they are going to build. I had to look over their doc and give suggestions for improvements, or ask them to expand upon things that were unclear.

Overall, this group's doc I reviewed today was a little sketchy. They definitely have the basic idea down, but like most groups, they skimp on the details, such as testing. Tomorrow, I have to meet with them in person to talk it over.

## Character profile: John

Here's a character profile on John, the character from _Kowagarijanai Chronicles_.

**Full name**: John Reginald Brown

**Age**: 20 years old.

**Physical description**: Somewhat tall and lanky. Has natural red hair that flips up in the front. For casual wear, you will often find him wearing slacks and a turtleneck sweater. While adventuring, he usually wears his doctor's lab coat (oddly enough, since you would rarely catch him wearing it during his school days).

**Personality**: Goofball and joker. Pretends to be dumb, but is actually quite intelligent. Very lazy, and so he rarely accomplishes much. Likes to play devil's advocate and talk details and technicalities.

**Biography**: Prior to becoming an adenturer, he was a medical student at a moderately good medical school.

When he was 9 years old, he and his family moved to a foreign country with a completely different language. They moved for business connections -- his family is quite wealthy, and his father is always chasing new business opportunities. John, in order to cover his shortcomings at the new language, pretended to be generally dumb, a characterization that has stuck ever since. Even his own parents joke that the only reason he got into med school is that he happened to guess correctly on the multiple choice questions in the entrance exam.

**Motiviation for becoming an adventurer**: No particular reason, other than wanting to run away from school. Perhaps in his mind there is something exciting and romantic about the idea of being an adventurer. However, he has never seriously put his life in danger before, so he does not know what he is getting into.

**Things he likes**: Sleeping and eating.

**Things he worries about**: He worries about other people thinking he is trying too hard or caring too much. 

**People he is close to**: His group of friends at school.

**People he is not close to**: His older brother, James. James is 7 years older than John, and works as a researcher at the world's most prestigious medical university. John and James have never been close, perhaps in part due to their age difference, and perhaps in part due to their personality difference, as James is extremely serious and hardworking.

**Fighting style**: A medic, John's primary role is to heal his allies when they take damage, and cure them of any illness that befalls them. He stays in the backlines of a fight, trying to keep himself out of danger. If both he and his allies get hurt at the same time, he prioritizes healing himself first before others, a habit that annoys Alice. However, this is actually a smart strategy, because if he were to be knocked out, no one else could revive him, and thus there would be no one left to heal the rest of the party.

## Star party!

Today we went to go look at the stars along with a couple of your friends.

They asked me if I am an astronomy buff. I wouldn't say that -- not as much as them, surely -- but I've always appreciated the stars.  In my youth, I read some books on astronomy, and I took a mini astrononmy course where we would go up to a building roof at night and look through telescopes and such. Although the science can be interesting, more than anything I just find the stars to be beautiful. I have always liked the idea of wishing on falling stars, as well.

We saw a number of cool things today. Saturn, Uranus, a planetary nebula, a globular cluster, and of course, the moon. By the way, did you notice that one of the people we talked to referred to these as "bright items"? I guess that is an umbrella term for referring to anything in the night sky, from planets, to stars, to nebula.

## Halloween candy

Today I came home to find that my parents had sent me some Halloween candy. Nice!

![Halloween candy](/images/blog_october/halloween_candy.jpg)

Here's a brief review of each one (from left to right, top to bottom):

- _Cocunut curry cashews:_ This is such a bizarre candy -- I just don't quite know what to think of the curry flavor -- but for some reason I think I like it.

- _Chocolate covered cherries:_ A surprise hit for me. I didn't think I would like this one so much, but it's up there as one of the best.

- _Pumpkin pie almonds:_ This one is all right, but a little boring. I think I would have preferred just straight up chocolate covered almonds!

- _White chocolate skull lollipop:_ I haven't tried this one yet!

- _Sour berry blocks:_ This one is _so_ good. It's just pure sugar pretty much, but I don't know, I just really like it!

## County Voter Information Guide
Recently I received the voting guide for my county, so I decided to take a look.

![County voting guide](/images/blog_october/county_voting_guide.jpg)

First and most important thing seems to be voting for Mountain View City Council. I read the candidate descriptions, but honestly could not tell what the difference between them at all. They all mentioned things like wanting to solve housing problems and transportation problems, but I have no idea what the specifics of their approaches are. Perhaps they don't even know themselves?

One curious thing is that nearly all of them mentioned wanting to come up with (in the words of one of the candidates) "solutions for our vehicle dweller population". Apparently this is a hot topic in the city politics. I had no idea.

Aside from council members, there are three measures to vote on.

- _Measure A_ is to continue a sales tax that goes into the city general fund. This one is weird because it says nothing about what the money is used for. Just that it goes into the general fund. Is that typical? I guess so. Apparently it's up to the council members to decide what the money is for, so that's why it's important to choose them carefully.

- _Measure P_ is to increase a business license tax and have it scale by business size. Apparently, all business currently pay $30. However, with this tax, for small businesses it would become $75 + $5 per employee. For large businesses it goes as high as $584,195 + $150 for each employee over 5,000. That's quite a hefty increase! Pretty much just creating a new tax. This money would also go into the general fund. 
  
    This one is hard to decide whether to vote for because honestly, I have no idea whether the given amounts are fair or not. I just don't know much about what kinds of costs it makes sense for business to pay.

- _Measure Q_ is about imposing a tax on cannabis businesses, even though they are currently not allowed in the city. Okay then. (However, it does mention that they may be allowed in the future.)

## The boy and the dog
Today I was walking home from dinner and I saw a funny scene. There was a baby boy, just old enough to walk, and his mother trying to get him to interact with a dog being walked by a person they had just randomly come across. However, the boy was too scared to approach the dog. So the mother started walking away. But then the boy ran back and was interested in the dog. And his mother tried to get him to pet it, and he almost did, but at the last moment he got scared and couldn't do it.

To be honest I was surprised the boy was afraid of the dog. I didn't think babies got scared of things like that. Though I guess it was a pretty big dog. Only medium-sized really, but bigger than the baby boy.

It made me wonder whether a fear of dogs begins young, and whether interaction with dogs at a young age would dispel that fear. I wonder about myself: if my mother had made me interact with dogs we came across when I was young, would I be as uncomfortable around dogs as I am today?

## Thoughts on Pixel 3

In the back of my mind I've been thinking I ought to get a new phone soon. My current phone is more than 3 years old, which is somewhat old by phone standards? Although to be honest, the only real wproblem with it is battery life. It doesn't even last all day -- I ran out of battery on our Berkeley trip last weekend, and I was barely using the phone other than to take a few photos.

If I were to get a new phone, which one would it be? I was waiting to see the reveal of Google's Pixel 3, hoping it would be the phone for me. But they revealed it today and... it's $800 for the cheapest version. Wow that is way too expensive. There's no way I would pay $800 for slightly improved battery life. Just think of all the incredible stuff I could buy with $800 instead! Like I could have cake every weekend for a year. Or a solid supply of imperial grade matcha. Or fund a nice trip somewhere.

![Pixel 3](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5bvi4a2qPYyrN6iM4n9JmW-650-80.jpg)
_Not my photo, from https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-pixel-3_

Also... the Pixel 3's battery life may not even be that good. You know it can't be too impressive when they don't advertise it. All they say is that it "Lasts all day" (whatever that means), that it has fast charging, and that it has a wireless charger. Better battery life is consistently one of the most requested improvements by the public, so when they kind of dance around it without explicitly mentioning it, you know it can't be anything special!

I guess I'll keep watching and waiting for another phone. I don't need the fanciest camera or the strongest processor, which is what phones seem to focus on these days. I just want better battery life, and a not ridiculous price.

## Things learned from Per Oscar

As I read further into _The Book of Japanese Tea_ by Per Oscar Brekell, I've decided to record some of the interesting things I've learned.

1. The reason different teas should be steeped at different temperatures is because the chemical compounds that make up the various flavors of the tea dissolve more readily at different temperatures. For example, the compounds responsible for bitterness dissolve more at higher temperatures compared to the compounds responsible for sweetness. Therefore, green tea should be steeped at low temperature to avoid excessive bitterness.

2. Even if tea should be steeped at low temperature, you should still heat the water to boiling, first. This can reduce the hardness of the water.

3. Most tea plants are clones, propagated by cuttings rather than seed pollination. However, a rare few tea plantations still use seed pollination. As a result, the tea plants have small amounts of genetic variation among them, and when mixed together this leads to less clearly defined flavor. This type of tea is known as _zairai_ (在来種).

4. Sencha, the most common green tea today, is not a traditional tea. It invented in 1738, and didn't become popular until after World War II.

5. There may be several tea harvests per season. The first harvest generally tastes the best, and so is most exensive. Why is it the best? Apparently, because it absorbs most of the nutrients in the soil, leaving less for the later harvests. That seems weird to me -- you'd think by now they would have engineered a way to spread the nutrients out better. But apparently not.

6. Tip for making the second steep of tea good: You should leave the lid of the teapot off between the first and second steep. This cools the teapot down. If the tea is sitting in a hot teapot with no water between the steeps, then it will become more bitter.

7. Have you seen these teapots with wide and flat bottoms? They are for cold brewing, because you want a lot of tea and very little water, just enough to barely cover the tea. 

    ![Flat bottom teapot](https://japaneseteasommelier.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/p1130425.jpg?w=400&h=267)

8. Per Oscar recommends drinking cold tea from a wine glass, since a wine glass is designed for letting you experience the aroma at cold temperatures.

Finally, some concluding words from Per Oscar, on why he decided to make this book bilingual: "In the sense that it deepens the understanding of other cultures and thereby lessens the friction between us, I believe that tea drinking may help us build a more peaceful world."

## West of San Antonio
The other day it occurred to me that I had never followed California to the west across San Antonio before. An area super near my place that I had never been to in 3 years, so I decided to go check it out.

Just one block in, I discovered a new park. Nice!

![Park 1](/images/blog_october/park1.jpg)

There were some cool frog statues at the park.

![Frog statue](/images/blog_october/frog_statue.jpg)

I also saw a sign for a bike/pedestrian bridge to Palo Alto.

![Bike bridge sign](/images/blog_october/bike_bridge_sign.jpg)

That sounded interesting, so I went to take a look. Unfortunately, to get to the bridge you have to go along those infamous sidewalk-less Los Altos roads. So not the most convenient bike/pedestrian bridge.

Along the way to the bridge, I found another park.

![Park 2](/images/blog_october/park2.jpg)

This is not a complete photo of the park, because I didn't want to photograph the people there. But it had swings! These are probably the closest swings to where I live.

Eventually, I found the bridge.

![Bike bridge](/images/blog_october/bike_bridge.jpg)

Honestly, I think it's quite pretty! There's a lot of greenery, and I like the wooden floor. Also, there's a little river next to it:

![Bike bridge river](/images/blog_october/bike_bridge_river.jpg)

Not too much water in it now, though.

At the end of the bike bridge, I ended up in a neighborhood, I guess in Palo Alto now? There was a nice looking path, so I decided to follow it.

![Palo Alto path](/images/blog_october/palo_alto_path.jpg)

This led me to yet another park.

![Park 3](/images/blog_october/park3.jpg)

Continuing past the park, I found myself in the middle of another neighborhood. In the middle was a large circular area where they were growing plants. A community garden, I guess?

![Community garden](/images/blog_october/community_garden.jpg)

And beyond that... another park.

![Park 4](/images/blog_october/park4.jpg)

I continued on and found myself at El Camino Real.

![El Camino Real](/images/blog_october/el_camino_real.jpg)

_Hey I know where this is! I can get home easily now!_ I think to myself as I start walking... only to realize a block later that I am going the wrong direction. I realized I was near Tofu House though, and thought I might stop by for dinner, but when I got there it was super busy so I decided not to wait.

On the way home I saw this horse:

![Weird horse](/images/blog_october/weird_horse.jpg)

I also got another view of the river from El Camino Real:

![El Camino Real river](/images/blog_october/el_camino_real_river.jpg)

Also, according to this sign, it's called "Adobe Creek". I hope that isn't named after the company.

![Adobe creek](/images/blog_october/adobe_creek.jpg)

And that concludes my exploration for the day! I found some pretty interesting stuff this time!

# 5 October
## Blue sky day
I took the day off, so we decided to visit Berkeley!

We decided to ride the Amtrak there. It was quite nice, actually! The Amtrak is alot more comfortable than Caltrain and BART. The one troublesome part is having to walk from the Amtrak station to downtown Berkeley. However, that's not so bad. If it were me, I'd go by Amtrak again next time!

Our first stop was lunch at Angeline's.

![Angeline's](/images/blog_october/angelines.jpg)

I got the gumbo, and you got the fried chicken. It was a bit heavy for the first meal of the day, but at least for me, I thought it ended up a good choice. It sustained me well throughout the day!

Next, you showed me a cool little library that could be found inside the main library. I never knew it was there! How did you find it? 

Here's a cool tiger that I saw in that library:

![Tiger picture](/images/blog_october/tiger_picture.jpg)

Next, we went up to the hill behind Clark Kerr. There we saw an incredibly blue sky. I'm not sure why, but it seemed bluer to me than I have ever seen before. Maybe the air was particularly clear up there, or maybe I was just paying more attention than usual. Either way, I was impressed with its beauty, and I felt so happy that I could share the moment with you.

![Tomomi and the blue sky](/images/blog_october/tomomi_and_the_blue_sky.jpg)

After that, we took a trip to Asha, and picked up dinner at Suya for the train ride home.

I can only speak for myself, but I had a wonderful day with you. Please take a piece of this day and put it in your perfect day bottle, for me.

# 4 October
## Per's words
I started reading _The Book of Japanese Tea_ by Per Oscar Brekell.

The first thing I noticed is that the author has quite a curious first name. It is so short, I wasn't even sure it was a name at first. I'm actually still not sure. In Japanese, it just says his name is ブレクル・オスカル, so it omits the "Per" part. I'm not sure what that means, is Per like a title or something?

Anyway, in the book, it mentions that Per was born in Sweden and moved to Japan in his college age to pursue his passion with tea. That's pretty intense if you ask me. I like tea well enough myself, but I'm not sure it would be a deciding reason for me to move to another country.

What is it that he likes so much about tea, anyway? Here is his reason, in his own words:

"In Japan, the saying _shichu no sankyo_ or _mountain dwelling in the city_ [...means that] even if located in a noisy urban environment, [tea] would would carry our thoughts away to a quiet and secluded life deep in the mountains, thereby creating a space where our minds can be liberated from the strains and struggles of everyday life."

That doesn't sound too bad, actually. I am in pursuit of that kind of peace, myself.

Some of Per's words can become a bit dramatic. Here's another line from him:

"In countries other than Japan [...] there is a tendency to emphasize the health benefits rather than the taste and flavor of the tea. Of course, I too believe that drinking green tea promotes good health. However, rather than drinking Japanese tea to prolong one's life, I would like to think of it as something that makes our time on earth richer and more enjoyable."

Despite the kind of dramatic writing style, I think I can agree with that as well.

# 3 October
## Food truck mania!
So I discovered that a food trucks comes to Milk Pail every Wednesday. I wasn't able to make it the past two weeks, but I made sure to try it out this week!

![Meating Spot](/images/blog_october/meating_spot.jpg)

The first thing I noticed is that this food truck ("The Meating Spot") is not the one that was here the previous week. That one was a Mexican food truck. I was really looking forward to trying that one, but I decided to give this one a shot anyway.

It was some kind of vaguely Asian themed food.

![Meating spot food](/images/blog_october/meating_spot_food.jpg)

To be honest, it wasn't very good! Overall, it was just very basic. Some rice, some kimchi, and some chicken with sauce over lettuce. And the rice was pretty hard and not tasty. It's too bad this one is no good. I hope the Mexican truck is back next week and that I'll get to try that one.

I did realize one thing though: I sure am eating at a lot of food trucks lately! There is this one, and the other one by Target, and also I like to go to the food trucks at work for lunch! Maybe I should give it a rest!

# 2 October
## Mega Man 11

One of the first games I ever played was Mega Man 2. 

![Mega Man 2 sky](http://2-dimensions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/megaman2-022.png)

![Mega Man 2 water](https://gonintendo.com/system/stories/promo_images/000/240/582/original/mega_man_2.jpg?1439656909)

This is a genre of game known as platformer. Essentially, your goal is to run, jump, and shoot your way to the end of the level.

I first played Mega Man 2 around 20 years ago, and even at the time, the game was old. The game was originally released in 1988.

Anyway, the series is still going, and today they released Mega Man 11, which I decided to buy. 

![Mega Man 11 power lines](/images/blog_october/mega_man_11_power_lines.jpg)

![Mega Man 11 forest](/images/blog_october/mega_man_11_forest.jpg)

The graphics have improved a little bit, but otherwise, it's very much the same type of game it was 30 years ago. I guess that's a part of the charm, though.

## One-Pan Coconut Chicken Curry _with Sweet Potatoes and Bok Choy_
Here's a new Blue Apron recipe I made.

![Coconut curry chicken](/images/blog_october/coconut_curry_chicken.jpg)

It was supposed to be curry... but all the liquid of the curry disappeared. I think it was a combination of me accidentally boiling it away and the sweet potatoes absorbing the rest.

As for the recipe, it was all right. Sweet potatoes are always good, and they go decently with the curry flavor. As for the bok choy, it felt like it was barely there. It shrunk a lot during cooking and I didn't really notice it while eating. At least it's healthy, though?

The chicken I overcooked slightly, but it wasn't bad!
