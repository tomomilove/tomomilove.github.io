## Alviso trip!

## Haircut + Zareen's trip!
Today I got a haircut! The instructions I give to the person who cuts my hair is "Number 3 on the sides, and about 1 inch left on top". Number 3 refers to the length of razor, I think. I'm guessing you don't give instructions like that when you get your hair cut, huh?

The haircut truck only comes to the main campus of my work, not the campus that my desk is at. So whenever I get a haircut I also make sure to take a trip to the Indian restaurant Zareen's, which is nearby! 

Zareen's is an eclectic place. I think we should definitely go there together one day! Remind me the next time we are thinking of going out to dinner. 

One odd thing they have is a shelf of books.

I wonder if anyone actually reads them...?

## Leaving teammates
This week two of my teammates at work announced they are leaving the team. One is going to another team, the other to another company. One of them is a huge loss for the team, as they were always really helpful to me and everyone. The other I didn't interact with much, since they were working on a fairly peripheral project. So peripheral, in fact, that I wonder if it will continue after they leave.

No matter how many times people leave, I never get used to it. Usually what happens is that the person sends an email, and then they are gone within a week. It always makes me feel bad when this happens: I guess because it's so sudden, and it feels so cold and emotionless. I feel like I want to be able to talk to them, reason with them, and convince them to stay, but of course that is impossible. By the time they've sent the email, the plans are already well in motion, the offers already signed, and so on.

Whenever a teammate leaves, I always wonder if I played a small part in it. If I had been nicer to them, more sociable, would they have stayed? Maybe I alone couldn't have changed anything, but still, perhaps I could have played a better role than I did. I resolve to try to be nicer to my remaining teammates.

## Fast internet
So I splurged to get ethernet, and I think it was a good decision! It has been so far, so good today.

Look, Google even describes my internet as _fast_ now!

I should have done this ages ago! Honestly, I wonder why I never considered it? I guess because I didn't even know powerline adapters existed.

## _Poems of Friendship_
I finally got around to reading this book. I can't quite remember when or why I received it. Did Tammy and Rachel give it to me? Was it for my birthday, or for some other reason?

![Poems of Friendship](/images/blog_september/poems_of_friendship.jpg)

There were some nice poems in here. I already ready you my two favorites. One of them, _Friendship_ by Dinah Maria Mulock Craik, says that a friend should do the following for all the things their friend says:

    "Take and sift them--
    Keep what is worth keeping--
    And with the breath of kindness
    Blow the rest away."

Kind of harsh, but not necessarily bad advice!

Another, _My Familiar_ by John Godfrey Saxe, complains of a friend who stays too long. It contains some witty couplets like:

    He takes the strangest liberties,--
        But never takes his leave!"

and

    "He opens everything he sees--
        Except the entry door!"
    
Here's another one I liked. It's _Friendship_ by Ella Wheeler Wilcox:

    "Dear friend, I pray thee, if thou wouldst be proving
        Thy strong regard for me,
    Make me no vows. Lip service is not loving;
        Let thy faith speak for thee.

    Swear not to me that nothing can divide us--
        So little such oaths mean.
    But when distrust and envy creep bseide us,
        Let them not come between.

    Say not to me the depths of thy devotion
        Are deepter than the sea;
    But watch, lest doubt or some unkind emotion
        Embitter them for thee.

    Vow not to love me ever and forever,
        Words are such idle things;
    But when we differ in opinions, never
        Hurt me by little stings.

    I'm sick of words: they are so lightly spoken,
        And spoken, are but air.
    I'd rather feel they trust in me unbroken
        Than list thy words so fair.

    If all the little proofs of trust are heeded,
        If thou art always kind,
    No sacrifice, no promise will be needed
        To satisfy my mind."

I want to take this one to heart. I tell you I love you a lot, but I want it to be more than words.

I haven't read poetry in a long time -- probably never since school? I found it nice to read some now, though. Sometimes poetry gets a bad rap for being boring or obtuse, but I think a good poem can delight with it's structure and word choice. For example, the poem about the friend who never goes away is a lot of fun because of its repetitive and rhythmic structure.

## Los Altos day!
A day where both of us were free to have fun! We took a trip (well, a walk) to Los Altos!

No trip to Los Altos is complete without going to Satura Cakes! Although this time, we didn't get a cake, just a peach soda.

![Peach soda](/images/blog_september/peach_soda.jpg)

It was pretty good! A little syrupy at first, but it was good after the ice melted a little. I would buy a canned version, maybe!

Next stop, the library!

![Los Altos library](/images/blog_september/los_altos_library.jpg)

It's kind of hidden away, isn't it? Kind of a contrast to the taller, more regal building that is the Mountain View library.

I took a walk around the building and discovered some nice trees. This one was large and beautiful. I can't quite remember, but I think it was a valley oak tree?

![Los Altos tree 1](/images/blog_september/los_altos_tree1.jpg)

I also found this sign pointing to Los Altos's sister cities:

Finally, we had dinner at Cafe Nur, a mediterranean restaurant. We both got the same thing: Lamb and beef doner plate!

![Cafe Nur](/images/blog_september/cafe_nur.jpg)

It was great, though it still doesn't match (the now out-of-business) Athineon in Berkeley. I still have never managed to find doner that matches the softness of the doner at Athineon.

We got free tea at Cafe Nur though!! Do you think I will be able to give away free tea at Koala Tea?

## Tiramisu 2

Today I made tiramisu again! It was so good last time that I just had to make it at least once more!

Here I am layering it...

![Tiramisu layer](/images/blog_september/tiramisu_layer.jpg)

Done!

![Tiramisu extra](/images/blog_september/tiramisu_extra.jpg)

Me: Huh? There's someone extra on top! What are you doing here?

Extra thing: I'm here to help keep the plastic wrap from touching the cream! That's useful, right?

Me: Uhh, I guess that's useful??
