# Fredericka the Great

## Tea and fox

The year is 1593. A civil war rages across the Loyal Kingdom that will forever alter the country's political future. Revolutionaries have declared the king illegitimate and announced a march on the royal capital, where they have promised to have the king's head and establish a new state of popular democracy. The revolutionary army, led by famed knight Sir Wystan of the Sea, has swept across the country in a fervor from the south, all the way to the Great Central River that divides the kingdom in half. Royal forces have gathered in the capital, just north of the river, and put the city in a state of martial law lockdown, although the hearts of the soldiers there isn't entirely in it. A bloody clash between the two armies seems imminent... 

But in the far northwest corner of the kingdom, in a remote region known only as the Dark Forest, more than 10 miles away from the nearest village, there is a woman who doesn't give a shit about any of that. Her name is Fredericka. She is a natural scientist, and in fact, the only scientist in the world studying the field of zoological linguistics -- essentially, how to talk to animals.

We join Fredericka on her 60th birthday, at her camp in the forest, having a tea party with two companions: her research assistant Naya, and a local fox.

Naya looks at the pot of steeping tea, surely ready just about now. “Shall I pour the tea, Lady Fredericka?”

“Like hell you will, Naya! It’s MY birthday so I get to pour the tea!” Fredericka snatches up the teapot. She pours into each cup with a flourish: staring the pot low then gradually raising it as she pours, finishing it off with a flick.

Naya watches Fredericka pour into the three cups. “Um, do foxes like tea, Lady Fredericka?”

“Ask him your damned self! Do you want to be a scientist, or do you want to be organizing notes forever, eh?”

Naya stares intently at the fox, but doesn’t say anything. The fox looks around absently and paws at the ground, searching for bugs.

Fredericka finishes pouring the three cups of tea and lets out a sigh. “Of course he likes tea, Naya. Otherwise I wouldn’t be pouring some for him, now would I? Though not all foxes like tea, same as humans. Some prefer juices.”

“And coffee?”

Fredericka lets out a laugh. “I haen’t met a fox that likes coffee yet, probably too strong for the little buggers. But who knows, maybe there’s one out there.”

Fredericka, Naya, and the fox sip their tea in silence. Fredericka gazes around the calm forest, admiring the dancing patterns of sun shining through the leaves, then eventually dozing off. Naya sits intently, trying to work up courage to pet the fox, but just before she is about to reach out, the fox darts off into the darkness of the woods, chasing a bird.

As the sun crosses the zenith and starts to sink, Naya says, "Well, I best be heading back to town now. I will see you next week for more work, Lady Fredericka."

Without moving from her napping position, Fredericka cracks open one eye. "Leaving so soon, lassie? Guess I oughta tell you something." Fredericka sits up. "I ain't gonna be here next week. I'm moving on. Breaking camp. You know."

"You... You are?"

"Aye. You been a real great help to me over the past year Naya, compiling my work, sendin' it off to those fancy ass journals and all. We ne'er got published, but still, we did good work, that you can be proud of." Fredericka flashes a teeth-baring grin at Naya.

Naya breaks eye contact and lowers her gaze. "What will you do now, Lady Fredericka?"

"I figure there's no point sittin' around waiting for those old coots to accept my work. I ain't getting any younger, you know. I gotta take my work to the next level, not for them, but for ME."

Naya frowns but doesn't say anything. Fredericka continues:

"The foxes here, they've been whispering things to me. You know what they say? They say this is only the edge of the forest. Deeper in, there's a cave, or a mountain, I'm not quite sure. And in that mountain, in the deepest part, there lives an animal. But not just any animal. They're telling me it's old. Like REALLY old. Supposedly the oldest living thing there is. And of course, foxes aren't known to exaggerate..."

By this point, Naya is listening to Fredericka, completely entranced. In a sudden movement, Fredericka leaps to her feet and puts her hands on her hips. "And you know what, now THAT sounds like an animal I've got to learn to talk to! If I missed the chance to pick that critter's brain, no way in hell I could call myself a real scientist!"

"Yeah!" Naya exclaims, jumping up herself.

"So I'm heading out! See ya, Naya!" Fredericka picks up her backpack off the ground and slings it over her shoulder for dramatic effect, as if she were about to leave just that moment. Although clearly, she can't leave quite yet because she hasn't packed up her camp.

"Wait a minute! I'm coming too!" declares Naya.

"Eh? You ready to leave town just like that? Well, I ain't gonna question it!" Fredericka gives Naya a hardy thump on the shoulder that nearly knocks her over. "Happy to have you!"

There is a light whining sound. The fox has reappeared at the camp.

"What does he say, Lady Fredericka?"

"He's going to show us part of the way there. Says to think of it as a birthday present of sorts. Ha! Never thought I'd see the day foxes take to human custom like that!"

## Talents of the fox

Fredericka, Naya, and the fox begin their journey into the forest. They follow a trail cut through the forest by Fredericka herself, worn into the earth over several years of zoological linguistics expeditions. Fredericka's trails form a sprawling network of paths branching off into many locations of interest, such as a secluded pond flush with frogs and lilies, a massive mudslide area that has become the home of an ant colony, and a grove of giant oak trees inhabited by a family of owls.

The fox leads them, treading lightly along in front of them, occasionally darting out of sight into the bushes but always returning when a new fork in the road comes up. Fredericka marches along behind the fox, contentedly humming to herself and keeping her eyes closed because she knows the paths so well. Birds fly overhead twittering, mice scurry alongside the path chattering, and squirrels peek their heads out of holes in the trees and jump across the branches squeaking. Fredericka greets them all, as if they were old friends of hers. Naya follows behind, looking about in wonder, having never traveled this far into the forest herself. Naya has been trying to keep track of the forks in the road that the fox has been leading them on and thinks they seem completely random. She wonders if the fox is playing a trick on them, as foxes are known to do, in stories.

The deeper they travel into the forest the thicker the vegetation grows. After a few days of travel, the sun can barely be seen through the treetops overhead and it becomes difficult to see more than a few meters ahead, even in the middle of the day. Naya gets out a lantern to help, though Fredericka still plunges ahead in front, saying, "You worry too much, lassie! Nothing's gonna hurt us here, it's just the woods, not a war zone, hahaha!"

The deeper they travel the quieter the forest animals grow, recognizing Fredericka less and less. On the fifth day of their journey they reach the end of Fredericka's trails, but Fredericka doesn't hesitate for a beat. She takes out her machete and swinging it with abandon, cutting them a new trail for them as the continue along, practically without slowing down at all.

While hacking her way through a particularly dense entanglement of foliage, Fredericka suddenly gets her foot caught on a root and lurches forward and off to the left. To her surprise, instead of hitting the ground, she finds only air. She is falling, then hits a net of branches, and keeps tumbling down through them. "Yaaaaaaaa!!!" she cries. Crack, tear, scratch! She is falling again through air, then finally hits the ground with a thud, falling unconscious.

When she awakes hours later, Fredericka finds herself lying on the ground in pitch black darkness. Her lantern, machete, and entire pack are gone, ripped from her during her fall, probably stuck somewhere in the mess of branches above her. Naya is nowhere to be seen either. "What in tarnations..." Fredericka mutters to herself as she sits up and looks around, rather pointlessly, into the darkness.

Thinking it over, she concludes that they must have been walking unwittingly along the edge of a cliff, and when she tripped, she fell down it, through the branches of trees rooted at the cliff's base. "Well! I certainly been through worse scrapes than this!" Fredericka calls out to no one in particular. She stands up, dusts herself off, and puts her hands on her hips. "Getting out of this should be no trouble!" she calls out. Then she stands in place, completely at a loss for what to do next.

Just then, she hears a quiet whimpering noise, and the fox emerges from the darkness and brushes up against Fredericka's leg. Fredericka bends down slightly and gives it a rub on the head. "You came for me, eh, you little bugger..."

Fredericka sits down and the fox curls up into her lap. "I'm needing your help here," she says. "I can't see a damn thing in the darkness, not nearly as well as you. Can't hear or smell as well as ya, either." Fredericka makes a series of whining and barking noises to communicate this to the fox, and the fox barks quietly in acknowledgment. "First thing's first is to find that girl, I s'pose. Remember where you left 'er?" Fredericka asks it.

The fox leaps out from Fredericka's lap and and starts walking off into the forest, following along the cliffside. Fredericka follows just a couple of feet behind the fox, not able to see hardly anything around her, pulling branches aside cautiously and stepping gingerly. Eventually, upon they reach of the base of a large tree, the fox stops suddenly, its ears twitching, seemingly having heard something. It scampers up the tree, leaving Fredericka to wait for it at the base.

A couple of minutes later, Fredericka hears a human voice echoing down from above to her. "Lady Fredericka!! Are you there!!" Fredericka looks up but can see nothing but darkness.

"Aye, I be here! I'll just climb this tree and be up to you in a bit!" Fredericka jumps on to the trie and starts propelling herself on the branches, but one snaps under the weight of her grasp and she falls, breaking the trees branches on her way to the ground. Now there no longer seems to be an easy way up the tree. Fredericka thinks for a moment then calls out:"Yo Naya!! Got a rope on you by any chance? Might be quicker than me climbing!"

She hears a rustling sound from above, then a moment later, Naya calls:"Ah, I have one! I'll let it down!" Naya dangle a rope down to Fredericka. "There you go!" she says.

"You're not planning' to just hold it are ya? Tie it to something, I don't think you can pull me up on your own like."

"Oh right, okay!!" A few minutes pass before Naya's voice calls down once again. "I think it's ready now!"

"That's my assistant! I'm heading up!" Fredericka starts climbing the rope.

After Fredericka has climbed about 10 meters up the rope, the knot Naya tied at the top of the rope starts to slip and quickly unravel. "Oh no oh no...!" Naya thinks to herself, and rushes to the grab the rope herself. Naya braces her feet against the ground but Fredericka's weight is too much for her. Fredericka falls and drags Naya over the cliff with her. They both fall, and as they hit the ground, their impact causes it to crumble beneath them. In an avalanche of mud, rocks, and foliage, they fall deeper into the darkness.
