# Fredericka the Great

## Tea and fox

The year is 1593. A civil war rages across the Loyal Kingdom that will forever alter the country's political future. Revolutionaries have declared the king illegitimate and announced a march on the royal capital, where they have promised to have the king's head and establish a new state of popular democracy. The revolutionary army, led by famed knight Sir Wystan of the Sea, has swept across the country in a fervor from the south, all the way to the Great Central River that divides the kingdom in half. Royal forces have gathered in the capital, just north of the river, and put the city in a state of martial law lockdown, although the hearts of the soldiers there isn't entirely in it. A bloody clash between the two armies seems imminent... 

But in the far northwest corner of the kingdom, in a remote region known only as the Dark Forest, more than 10 miles away from the nearest village, there is a woman who doesn't give a shit about any of that. Her name is Fredericka. She is a natural scientist, and in fact, the only scientist in the world studying the field of zoological linguistics -- essentially, how to talk to animals.

We join Fredericka on her 60th birthday, at her camp in the forest, having a tea party with two companions: her research assistant Naya, and a local fox.

Naya looks at the pot of steeping tea, surely ready just about now. “Shall I pour the tea, Lady Fredericka?”

“Like hell you will, Naya! It’s MY birthday so I get to pour the tea!” Fredericka snatches up the teapot. She pours into each cup with a flourish: staring the pot low then gradually raising it as she pours, finishing it off with a flick.

Naya watches Fredericka pour into the three cups. “Um, do foxes like tea, Lady Fredericka?”

“Ask him your damned self! Do you want to be a scientist, or do you want to be organizing notes forever, eh?”

Naya stares intently at the fox, but doesn’t say anything. The fox looks around absently and paws at the ground, searching for bugs.

Fredericka finishes pouring the three cups of tea and lets out a sigh. “Of course he likes tea, Naya. Otherwise I wouldn’t be pouring some for him, now would I? Though not all foxes like tea, same as humans. Some prefer juices.”

“And coffee?”

Fredericka lets out a laugh. “I haen’t met a fox that likes coffee yet, probably too strong for the little buggers. But who knows, maybe there’s one out there.”

Fredericka, Naya, and the fox sip their tea in silence. Fredericka gazes around the calm forest, admiring the dancing patterns of sun shining through the leaves, then eventually dozing off. Naya sits intently, trying to work up courage to pet the fox, but just before she is about to reach out, the fox darts off into the darkness of the woods, chasing a bird.

As the sun crosses the zenith and starts to sink, Naya says, "Well, I best be heading back to town now. I will see you next week for more work, Lady Fredericka."

Without moving from her napping position, Fredericka cracks open one eye. "Leaving so soon, lassie? Guess I oughta tell you something." Fredericka sits up. "I ain't gonna be here next week. I'm moving on. Breaking camp. You know."

"You... You are?"

"Aye. You been a real great help to me over the past year Naya, compiling my work, sendin' it off to those fancy ass journals and all. We ne'er got published, but still, we did good work, that you can be proud of." Fredericka flashes a teeth-baring grin at Naya.

Naya breaks eye contact and lowers her gaze. "What will you do now, Lady Fredericka?"

"I figure there's no point sittin' around waiting for those old coots to accept my work. I ain't getting any younger, you know. I gotta take my work to the next level, not for them, but for ME."

Naya frowns but doesn't say anything. Fredericka continues:

"The foxes here, they've been whispering things to me. You know what they say? They say this is only the edge of the forest. Deeper in, there's a cave, or a mountain, I'm not quite sure. And in that mountain, in the deepest part, there lives an animal. But not just any animal. They're telling me it's old. Like REALLY old. Supposedly the oldest living thing there is. And of course, foxes aren't known to exaggerate..."

By this point, Naya is listening to Fredericka, completely entranced. In a sudden movement, Fredericka leaps to her feet and puts her hands on her hips. "And you know what, now THAT sounds like an animal I've got to learn to talk to! If I missed the chance to pick that critter's brain, no way in hell I could call myself a real scientist!"

"Yeah!" Naya exclaims, jumping up herself.

"So I'm heading out! See ya, Naya!" Fredericka picks up her backpack off the ground and slings it over her shoulder for dramatic effect, as if she were about to leave just that moment. Although clearly, she can't leave quite yet because she hasn't packed up her camp.

"Wait a minute! I'm coming too!" declares Naya.

"Eh? You ready to leave town just like that? Well, I ain't gonna question it!" Fredericka gives Naya a hardy thump on the shoulder that nearly knocks her over. "Happy to have you!"

There is a light whining sound. The fox has reappeared at the camp.

"What does he say, Lady Fredericka?"

"He's going to show us part of the way there. Says to think of it as a birthday present of sorts. Ha! Never thought I'd see the day foxes take to human custom like that!"
