Here I write reviews on movies, etc. that we've seen together!

## Isle of Dogs

![Isle of Dogs](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyOTUwNjAxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODcyMzE0NDM@._V1_.jpg)

_Isle of Dogs_ is a bizarre dystopian film about a world in which dogs are banished to an island to die.

What struck me most about this film is how much it's not really what you would expect it to be. It's an animated film about dogs, yet the dogs are not cute. They are ugly and often quite beaten up. It's a primarily American and German made film, yet the story takes place in Japan, and the film deliberately tries to highlight that. The film seems like maybe a comedy or an adventure film, and it portrays some pretty raw and shocking scenarios, yet it doesn't drum up excitement and overreactions as much as other movies would. Characters tend to react quietly, and events happen in matter-of-fact ways.

I can't help but appreciate the craftsmanship that went into this film. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Dogs_(film)), they made more than 3,000 puppets and 20,000 faces for the film. I really have to wonder why they chose to do something so work intensive, rather than go with something like computer animation, but I can appreciate the effort that went into it.

I think that about sums up my overall feelings on the film. There are a lot of things in it I don't understand why they did, but it results in such a unique film unlike any I have watched that I have to rate it 5/5.

## Crazy Rich Asians

Beware this review contains spoilers for the film!

![Crazy Rich Asians](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/ba/Crazy_Rich_Asians_poster.png)

_Crazy Rich Asians_ is a movie that tells the story of Rachel Chu and the events surrounding her engagement to Nick Young.

While watching the film, it feels very complete and satisfying. However, thinking about it in hindsight, I was surprised about how much the film _doesn't_ show. We never really learn what Nick wants to do with his career, for example (Does he want to take over the family business? If he stayed behind in New York, what would he do instead?) We also never really learn Rachel's thoughts on Singapore or its people (Would she be happy living there assuming people generally accept her? Was that option ever on the table or does she feel like she has to live in America?). And we never get a scene that really explicitly shows why Rachel and Nick love each other; instead, their relationship is kind of taken for granted (Also we don't see the scene where Rachel rejects Nick's first proposal, which should be an important moment for them, right?). Also, we never get to meet Nick's father or learn his perspective on things (Unless he is gone for some reason that I missed?).

This missing information, however, is actually a strength of the film. We never learn much about Nick or his relationship with Rachel because we don't need to. The film isn't really about him or their relationship. It's actually more about Rachel and her conflict with Nick's mother Eleanor. By focusing very specifically on this conflict and discarding other details, the film keeps up a tight, brisk pacing while still managing to feel complete.

Focusing on Rachel's conflict with Eleanor turns out to be a good choice, because it's quite a compelling conflict. One reason I think it works well is that Rachel and Eleanor are very similar in some ways, but very different in others. You really want them to be able to see eye to eye, despite the difficulties.

Anyway, this review is getting long, so I'll wrap it up. It's a great film with a very compelling, emotional narrative. I cried at several points during the film, which is always a good sign. I rate it 5/5!

## Napoletana Pizzeria

![Napoletana pizza](/images/reviews/napoletana_pizza.jpg)

Napoletana Pizzeria is a local restaurant that serves [neapolitan style pizza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapolitan_pizza). Supposedly the original style of pizza, in order to make this pizza officially you need to follow very specific requirements. According to the Wikipedia article: "It must be made with San Marzano tomatoes, which grow on the volcanic plains to the south of Mount Vesuvius, and Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, a protected designation of origin cheese made with the milk from water buffalo raised in the marshlands of Campania and Lazio in a semi-wild state."

Regardless of the specific requirements, I have to say I love the pizza at Napoletana. The sauce has a great flavor to it, and the crust is cooked just right. Sometimes they overdo it on the salt and the olive oil, but usually it's good. The calzone is a must try! The ricotta and salami add extra flavors that elevate it beyond the other pizzas.

If there's one complaint I have about Napoletana, it's the size of the pizzas. They're slightly too big for one serving, but they're too small to split between two people. I wish each pizza was around 80% of its size.

Ultimately though, if my only complaint is that you might get too much of a good thing, I have to rate it 5/5!

## Shalala

![Shalala](/images/blog_july/shalala.jpg)

It's our most visited restaurant, Shalala!

I've eaten a few different things here: the ramen, the curry, and the karaage chicken.

- The ramen: I can't remember much about it, actually. It's been a while since I've had it. I don't typically get ramen because I'm not a huge fan. I think the broth is just too heavy for me, usually? Maybe I would like a small bowl of ramen, but the big bowls that restaurants serve are too much for me!

- The curry: I've had the croquette curry and the tonkatsu curry, and both are good! Again though, I think it is a little much for me.

- The karaage: Not bad, although your mom's is much better! I think I wouldn't order this again -- it's just not good enough in comparison! One thing I can compliment about it though, is that the chicken was very soft. No hard pieces or bones or anything!

- The salad: I have to give a special shoutout to the side salad I get with my diehes. I really like it! I wonder what dressing they use? I want to try to recreate it.

- The ambience: No restaurant review is complete without mentioning the ambience! Although Shalala can feel cramped sometimes, I do like its smallness. I think the smallness combined with the fact that we've been there so many times makes it seem cozy and familiar. Shalala feels nice, but not too fancy.

Overall, I really like Shalala. I think what I like most about it is memories of spending time with you there! I rate it 5/5.

## Undertale (2015)

__Heads up: This review contains full spoilers for the game.__

In this RPG, you take the role of a kid from the modern world wearing a striped shirt, who engages in turn-based, rhythm-based battles with silly monsters. The monsters are often twisted versions of things from the real world, and each has a distinct personality, which the game narrates to you as you do battle with them. The game's story ranges from funny, to touching, to depressing, to creepy, to downright strange. It also features pixel graphics with a simplistic and blocky colors.

If this sounds familiar, it's because I've just described the [EarthBound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound) series of games by Nintendo. The fact that that paragraph could just as easily have been about _Undertale_ underscores just how heavily _EarthBound_ influenced _Undertale_. And it's not just _EarthBound_, _Undertale_ also draws inspiration from a plethora of classic games, such as the indie darling _Cave Story_, the bullet hell shooter genre, the dating sim genre, and even _Dance Dance Revolution_. But while _Undertale_ takes many cues from old games, it does not merely copy. _Undertale_'s brilliance lies in how it takes this legacy, expands upon it, and then goes in a wholly original direction.

_EarthBound_ was always famous for its silly take on the RPG genre (compared to the high drama swords and sorcery of _Final Fantasy_, etc), and its most iconic aspect was the way in which the monsters you fight have personalities, and the way the game describes the silly things they do and how they react to you. But while these descriptions were never much more than flavor text in _EarthBound_, _Undertale_ takes this idea much further, making it into a central mechanic in the game. Battles essentially revolve around reading into the monsters' personalities and figuring out how to react to them in order to bring them inner peace. There's a puzzle element to this which is a lot of fun, though I wish they could have taken this a bit further with the boss fights, which often boil down to just sparing repeatedly as you stall for time while dodging.

Unfortunately, I don't find the dodging mechanic very fun. Mostly it's just kind of stressful. Though to the game's credit, it does a lot of creative things with mechanic, often adding interesting twists in each boss fight. So, at least it doesn't get boring.

Putting the gameplay aside, let's discuss story. I love what I'll call the game's base plot. A human falls into the monster world, and is faced with the choice to remain there forever, or to kill in order to escape. The difficult moral choice is compelling, and it culminates in an incredible, iconic final battle against the king Asgore. You really feel the heavy weight carried by the two combatants who desperately don't want to kill each other, but still feel like they must.

After that battle, however, the story goes a little off the rails. It goes into what I'll call the game's expanded, or meta plot. You learn about things like the first human who fell to the underground, multiple timelines, Asriel, etc. Personally I didn't find this part of the game very compelling, as I feel it gets too complicated for its own good, and it's hard to care about characters you don't get to personally interact with during the main game (Asriel and the first human).

Convoluted ending aside, I love the rest of the story. The side character scenes where you befriend the likes of Papyrus, Undyne, and Alphys are a highlight, as they are both hilarious and touching.

By the way, I can't end this review without mentioning the music, which is incredible. You've got a range from the [super groovy theme of hot land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNN0HyO3rM4) to the moody, resigned determination of [Asgore's theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcamjcoRmrQ).

Rich with inspiration yet boldly creative, _Undertale_ is a game that celebrates the past while not being tied down to it. It creates an experience unlike any other, and I foresee it to be hugely influential itself on games to come. I rate it 5/5.

## Moana (2016)

Walt Disney Animation Studio's latest film _Moana_ is an adventure film based heavily in the culture of various islands in the Pacific Ocean. Many modern American audiences may find Moana's world to be novel, as it stands out from the European inspired worlds of recent Disney princesses. But to me, Moana's world actually feels a bit familiar, and stirs some specific childhood memories of mine. Let me explain.

When I was a kid, there was a line of LEGO toys I liked called Bionicle. I never really thought about it at the time, but in hindsight, Bionicle was a pretty unique toy line: the characters were all robots, but they lived in nature on an island, and their world was heavily based on Polynesian culture, just like Moana.

In fact, Bionicle's world shares some specific references with Moana's. For example, the island that the Bionicles lived on was called Mata Nui, very similar to the name of Moana's island, Motu Nui. This isn't a coincidence, as neither are very creative names actually: "Nui" just means "Great", and is a common suffix for island names. "Motu" means "Island", so Moana's island is literally just named "Great Island". "Mata" means "Face", so Bionicle's island is named "Great Face". And that leads us to another connection: Bionicle's island actually is the face of a sleeping god. This is very similar to Te Fiti in Moana, who is both a goddess and an island. I have to imagine these are both a reference to some specific bit of Polynesian mythology, but I wasn't able to find what it is.

One thing I was able to find, though, is the fact that Maui is a well-known hero within Polynesian mythologies. Furthermore, it appears that most of the references to his exploits that are in the movie are references to actual myths. For example: the fact that tried to win good things for humanity: he held up the sky, restrained the sun, pulled islands from the ocean, and stole fire. These are all actual myths. Although the movie doesn't reference his last and most bizarre adventure: The last thing Maui tried to get for humanity was immortality. Apparently, in order to win immortality, what he had to do was transform into a worm, then enter the Goddess of death through her vagina and come out her mouth. Unfortunately for him, her vagina had teeth, and bit him in half when he tried. And that was the end of Maui.

...Anyway, this wasn't much of a review, but I hope you enjoyed learning about this mythology like I did. I think it's cool that Moana seems to have done its research and made a lot of legit references. Though it takes some creative liberties, too (apparently, Maui's depiction isn't really accurate, as he's usually depected as lithe and youthful).

Conclusion: Great adventure, cool world, legit references. I rate it 5/5.

## La La Land (2016)

_La La Land_ is a musical about two people trying to fulfill their career dreams.

Let's get this out of the way right now: this movie is all about the music, and the music is really fun. I love the jazzy sounds, and I love the piano. I love the happy, upbeat songs, and I love the slow, sweet ones. And it's not just the sound, but the visuals too: the mass crowd dancing scenes are a delight.

One aspect of the film that initially struck me as odd is the fact that the reality of the movie isn't always plausible. It tends to blur the line between what's "really happening" and what's just a stylistic choice: for example, are we to really believe that a bunch of cars all stop on the freeway and everyone gets out and dances? Are we to really believe that the two main characters just carry tap dancing shoes around with them which they can take out whenever the need to dance arises? Are we to really believe that the main character sings her way through an acting audition? None of these moments are really plausible, but the film still works because all of these moments are in service of the music. The film has its priorities straight: be stylish and make the music fun. Plausability can take a backseat.

Plot also takes a bit of a backseat here. The plot that's there is fairly straightforward, but it works well enough to add some emotional punch to the music. You understand what the various songs mean to the characters, and this is what makes the emotional moments of the film hit. Again, the music takes priority.

The main conflict in the plot involves the characters making a choice between following their dreams or chasing love. Curiously, the film seems to avoid passing judgment on its characters. The end of the film gives you a brief glimpse into the world they chose and also a brief glimpse into the hypothetical world they didn't choose, but it doesn't seem to suggest that either is better. How do the characters feel about their choices? Do they want to say anything else to each other, or are they fine leaving things? It leaves you wanting to know more, but it also gives you something to think about and debate over after the film is over, and that's always a good thing.

Conclusion: Fun, stylish, and musical. I rate it 5/5.

## Love Me If You Dare (2004)

_Love Me If You Dare_ (aka _Jeux d'Enfants_) is a film about two people daring each other to do increasingly crazy things and building love along the way. 

I appreciate how the film really commits to this concept, and goes all out exploring what happens as the dares continue to escalate.

One of the major themes of the film is how the two main characters are unable to be honest with each other and instead hide behind their jokes. I really enjoyed the film exploring this. Hiding your true feelings behind a joking demeanor is a dynamic that seems to underpin so much human interaction, yet I haven't seen it used often in films.

Watching this film, I really felt for the characters and the incredible hole they dig themselves into. It left me wondering: at one point did things go wrong for them? Could their fate have been averted somehow? When I trace back the source of negativity, I find the critical, turning point in the plot (i.e. the climax) is actually somewhere in the middle of the film, and everything that comes after it is the fallout. This actually makes the film a little depressing to watch, since so much of it is dedicated to watching the increasingly destructive train wreck of their relationship. Though, simultaneously, this is what makes the film so unique.

It would be disingenuous, however, to suggest the film is that simple. Yes, the film does seem to be saying it's a bad thing that the characters can't be honest and hide behind their game, since this leads to the destruction of their relationship. But there is another layer here. The film _also_ portrays their game as a good thing, since it frees them from the monotony of a rigid social life.

So what exactly is the film saying? Is their game a bad or a good thing? Maybe the (original) title holds a clue: _Jeux d'Enfants_, or "child games". Maybe the film means to reflect both the bad and the good of childhood: both its immaturity and its freedom.

Conclusion: A thought-provoking take on childhood. I rate it 5/5.

## The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017)

In _Breath of the Wild_, you take the role of Link, tasked with saving the land of Hyrule from the threat of the evil Ganon. And that's it: that's all the instruction you're given. From there, you can go wherever you want and do whatever you want.

This game eschews the format of previous Zelda games (and most video games) that require you to complete set tasks in a given order in order to proceed. What makes _Breath of the Wild_ unique is how you can do anything in any order, or even just skip major events and go directly to the ending.

This freedom is what makes the game so fun to play. You can go completely at your own pace, and you never feel like the game is making you do something you don't want to do. You might worry that the lack of clear direction would make you feel less motivated to do things, but actually, it's the opposite. Since you do only the things you choose to do, everything feels important.

Complementing the freedom of the game's structure is the freedom of the gameplay itself. You can climb almost any surface, so there is no place in the world you can't get to. And there are so many ways to travel, whether by horseback, or gliding, or surfing. There are always multiple ways to solve puzzles and multiple ways to approach enemy fights. Do you charge in with your sword? Stay back and use bomb arrows? Freeze enemies with stasis? Or maybe you just sneak in, steal the treasure, and then run.

Ultimately, what makes the game work is that the world is fun to play in. It's fun to explore mountain ranges, to capture and raise horses. to go fishing with bombs, to hunt dragons, to gather ingredients and cook weird meals, to light everything on fire and then glide on the updrafts.

The story, though simple, gives you just enough to care about the characters. Zelda isn't so perfect: she's moody and immature. But this provides a hook that makes you enjoy watching her relationship with Link improve over time.

The music is sparse, as there isn't any when you're just wandering around the world. But this is probably for the better, since you'll spend so much time wandering around you'd probably get sick of any song. Instead, the music serves to highlight important events and places.

Conclusion: A game with remarkable openness that just lets you have fun in your own way. I rate it 5/5.
