Here I write reviews on movies, etc. that we've seen together!

## La La Land (2016)

_La La Land_ is a musical about two people trying to fulfill their career dreams.

Let's get this out of the way right now: this movie is all about the music, and the music is really fun. I love the jazzy sounds, and I love the piano. I love the happy, upbeat songs, and I love the slow, sweet ones. And it's not just the sound, but the visuals too: the mass crowd dancing scenes are a delight.

One aspect of the film that initially struck me as odd is the fact that the reality of the movie isn't always plausible. It tends to blur the line between what's "really happening" and what's just a stylistic choice: for example, are we to really believe that a bunch of cars all stop on the freeway and everyone gets out and dances? Are we to really believe that the two main characters just carry tap dancing shoes around with them which they can take out whenever the need to dance arises? Are we to really believe that the main character sings her way through an acting audition? None of these moments are really plausible, but the film still works because all of these moments are in service of the music. The film has its priorities straight: be stylish and make the music fun. Plausability can take a backseat.

Plot also takes a bit of a backseat here. The plot that's there is fairly straightforward, but it works well enough to add some emotional punch to the music. You understand what the various songs mean to the characters, and this is what makes the emotional moments of the film hit. Again, the music takes priority.

The main conflict in the plot involves the characters making a choice between following their dreams or chasing love. Curiously, the film seems to avoid passing judgment on its characters. The end of the film gives you a brief glimpse into the world they chose and also a brief glimpse into the hypothetical world they didn't choose, but it doesn't seem to suggest that either is better. How do the characters feel about their choices? Do they want to say anything else to each other, or are they fine leaving things? It leaves you wanting to know more, but it also gives you something to think about and debate over after the film is over, and that's always a good thing.

Conclusion: Fun, stylish, and musical. I rate it 5/5.

## Love Me If You Dare (2004)

_Love Me If You Dare_ (aka _Jeux d'Enfants_) is a film about two people daring each other to do increasingly crazy things and building love along the way. 

I appreciate how the film really commits to this concept, and goes all out exploring what happens as the dares continue to escalate.

One of the major themes of the film is how the two main characters are unable to be honest with each other and instead hide behind their jokes. I really enjoyed the film exploring this. Hiding your true feelings behind a joking demeanor is a dynamic that seems to underpin so much human interaction, yet I haven't seen it used often in films.

Watching this film, I really felt for the characters and the incredible hole they dig themselves into. It left me wondering: at one point did things go wrong for them? Could their fate have been averted somehow? When I trace back the source of negativity, I find the critical, turning point in the plot (i.e. the climax) is actually somewhere in the middle of the film, and everything that comes after it is the fallout. This actually makes the film a little depressing to watch, since so much of it is dedicated to watching the increasingly destructive train wreck of their relationship. Though, simultaneously, this is what makes the film so unique.

It would be disingenuous, however, to suggest the film is that simple. Yes, the film does seem to be saying it's a bad thing that the characters can't be honest and hide behind their game, since this leads to the destruction of their relationship. But there is another layer here. The film _also_ portrays their game as a good thing, since it frees them from the monotony of a rigid social life.

So what exactly is the film saying? Is their game a bad or a good thing? Maybe the (original) title holds a clue: _Jeux d'Enfants_, or "child games". Maybe the film means to reflect both the bad and the good of childhood: both its immaturity and its freedom.

Conclusion: A thought-provoking take on childhood. I rate it 5/5.

## The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017)

In _Breath of the Wild_, you take the role of Link, tasked with saving the land of Hyrule from the threat of the evil Ganon. And that's it: that's all the instruction you're given. From there, you can go wherever you want and do whatever you want.

This game eschews the format of previous Zelda games (and most video games) that require you to complete set tasks in a given order in order to proceed. What makes _Breath of the Wild_ unique is how you can do anything in any order, or even just skip major events and go directly to the ending.

This freedom is what makes the game so fun to play. You can go completely at your own pace, and you never feel like the game is making you do something you don't want to do. You might worry that the lack of clear direction would make you feel less motivated to do things, but actually, it's the opposite. Since you do only the things you choose to do, everything feels important.

Complementing the freedom of the game's structure is the freedom of the gameplay itself. You can climb almost any surface, so there is no place in the world you can't get to. And there are so many ways to travel, whether by horseback, or gliding, or surfing. There are always multiple ways to solve puzzles and multiple ways to approach enemy fights. Do you charge in with your sword? Stay back and use bomb arrows? Freeze enemies with stasis? Or maybe you just sneak in, steal the treasure, and then run.

Ultimately, what makes the game work is that the world is fun to play in. It's fun to explore mountain ranges, to capture and raise horses. to go fishing with bombs, to hunt dragons, to gather ingredients and cook weird meals, to light everything on fire and then glide on the updrafts.

The story, though simple, gives you just enough to care about the characters. Zelda isn't so perfect: she's moody and immature. But this provides a hook that makes you enjoy watching her relationship with Link improve over time.

The music is sparse, as there isn't any when you're just wandering around the world. But this is probably for the better, since you'll spend so much time wandering around you'd probably get sick of any song. Instead, the music serves to highlight important events and places.

Conclusion: A game with remarkable openness that just lets you have fun in your own way. I rate it 5/5.
