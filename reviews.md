# La La Land

_La La Land_ is a musical about two people trying to fulfill their career dreams.

This movie is all about the music, and the music is really fun. 

I love the mass crowd scenes, where everyone is singing and dancing.

The logic of the movie isn't always plausible, and it tends to blur the line between what's "really happening" and what's just a stylistic choice. But that's because it has its priorities straight: it knows that the music comes first.

The plot that's their is fairly straightforward, but it works well enough to add some emotional punch to the music. You understand what the various songs mean to the characters, and this is what makes the emotional moments of the film hit home.

Final score: 5/5

# Love Me If You Dare

I really appreciate the film's commitment to its concept. It goes all out.

One of the major themes of the film is how the two main characters are unable to be honest with each other and hide behind jokes. I thought it was an interesting message that I haven't seen before much.

Final score: 5/5

# The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

A game where you can go anywhere and do anything, entirely at your own pace.

This game eschews the format of previous Zelda games (and most video games in general), that require you to go through the parts of game in a specific order.

Ultimately, what makes the game work is that the world is fun to play in. It's fun to climb mountains and glide down from them,it's fun to capture and ride horses,
