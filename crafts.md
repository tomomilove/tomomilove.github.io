## The searching man

Let's make the searching man!

![Complete searching man](/images/searching_man/complete.jpg)

### Materials
- Some blue pipecleaners (aka chenille stems) and one green one.
- Red felt.
- A bit of white paper. Preferably something thicker than printer paper, such as cardstock.
- Something to stick felt together. Hot glue works is one option, sewing is another. Regular paper glue probably won't work.

### Instructions

#### Part 1: The empty man

![The empty man](/images/searching_man/empty_man.jpg)

Once upon a time there was a man with no heart. The only thing inside him was emptiness.

Let's begin by making the lower half of the body. Take one pipecleaner and twist it into the following shape.

Use a second pipecleaner to add the arms and neck. Be sure to wrap the shoulders around the top of the string so that they are locked in place.

Bend the neck. This will be the nose.

Wrap multiple pipelcleaners around the nose and neck to create the head. This doesn't have to be exact. Just add as many as you think look good, and squish them into a nice shape.

Glue on the eyes. They're just little pieces of paper with pen markings.

#### Part 2: The searching man

One day the empty man decided he wasn't satisfied with being empty. He decided he wanted a heart. But how to get one? He had no idea, so he decided to wander the world in search of one.

Of course, he couldn't go out searching without his favorite adventurer's coat. Let's build his coat now.

Here are the different pieces we'll need. From top to bottom they are: A collar, the front and back of the torso, an arm, a belt, and coattails.

In my case, the width of the front of the coat at the waist is 3cm. This means that the belt and coattails are 6cm wide, since they have to wrap around the back. I've drawn dashes where they could be folded around back.

As I've done here, I recommend making paper versions of all the pieces and checking their size against the empty man before cutting out the actual felt.

Once you've done, cut out the coattails and glue them to the empty man.

![Coattails](/images/searching_man/coattails.jpg)

Fold the edges of the coattails in front and glue the belt on top, keeping them in place.

Attach the back of the torso.

![Torso back](/images/searching_man/torso_back.jpg)

Make the torso front. Add some collar detail.

Put on the torso front, tucking it under the belt. Also wrap the belt around and fasten it. Glue the top of the front torso piece to the top of the back torso piece, but do _not_ glue their sides together. Leave them open, so we can insert the sleeves later.

Add the sleeves.

Finally, attach the collar on the back. (Also notice that I had to due some stitching to get things to stay)

Now we're done! But the searching man looks a little perplexed. He searched the world over for many days and many nights, but he could never find a heart...

#### Part 3: The cultivating man

Exhausted from his long search, the searching man was forced to conclude that he would never find a heart. That's when he thought of a new idea: he would grow one! 

So he ripped a shred of cloth from his coat, planted it in the ground, and watered it every day. Soon enough, a sprout emerged from the ground and started to grow. He continued to take care of it dilligently. He watered it without fail, shielded it from the sun when it was too hot, and made sure to adjust it if it started growing crooked. It was a lot of work, but he kept going, knowing that one day it would grow into a beautiful heart that he could call his own.
