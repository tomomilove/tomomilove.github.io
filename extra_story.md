# The first life of Yamamoto Emika


I hear the sound of gently lapping waves. I open my eyes, but see only darkness. I am lying face down on the ground. Confused, I push myself up, and it is easier than I expect: my body feels light and my arms feel strong, as if I have no weariness whatsoever.

I look around. I am standing on a sandy beach, and a calm ocean stretches before me. I don’t recognize this place. Was I just washed ashore from somewhere further away? More strange, however, is the sky: it is pitch black. There is no sun, no moon, no stars, no clouds. There is nothing on the horizon either, no mountains or detail. And there is nothing between me and the horizon either, other than the dark waters.

Thinking about the pitch black sky, it strikes me as odd that I can see anything at all. If there really is no light source, then how can I see the sand, or the water, or myself?  The lighting on these objects is somewhat flat, almost as if they were emitting their own light.

Taking a closer look at myself, I notice that I am barefoot. I am wearing a simple green dress and khaki trousers, and my hair is long and down. I remember this outfit; I haven’t dressed like this since I was a young woman back in my home village, when I spent my days running around the forest and trying to teach myself magic. I look at the sand and barely begin to think of it, when a plant shoots out of the ground, and starts growing into the sky. It’s the plant-growing magic spell I struggled so hard to learn back then, but never could! Somehow, it comes naturally to me now.

Nothing is making sense. Standing around isn’t going to answer my questions, so I decide to explore around. I walk over to the water’s edge and peer at my own face through the ripples. Just as I thought, I appear to be about the age I was when I left home. What is going on here? The last I remember, I was 52 years old. So is this a dream? No, it seems too real…

Wait a minute -- what _is_ the last thing I remember, anyway? I was 53 years old, and… wearing my military uniform. What was I doing? I was in the midst of a battle in a war to conquer the Kingdom of Theria, the last major power standing between my empire and world domination. Victory was just within our grasp, I was leading a charge of my troops to take down their general, I was running across a bridge over a bay inlet, suddenly I heard an explosion behind me, and… that’s the last thing I remember. Wait, was I shot by something? Am I dead? No, nonono, no way…

My mind racing, I look around me. Darkness all around, except at one point in the distance, across the sand, I can see the faint light of a flame. I start to rush over towards the light, hoping there is a person there I can ask questions. But partway there, I slow my pace to a walk. If I really am dead, what’s the rush? I have prided myself on being composed no matter the situation, and I intend to keep that up.

As I near the light, I can see it is a lantern being held by a cloaked figure. The figure is standing on the sand, by the water’s edge, and a small paddle boat floats next to them. They speak:

Cloaked figure: Welcome, dead one!

Emika: So I am dead.

Cloaked figure: Yes of course. I only appear once people have figured that out. It’s too much trouble to argue with people in denial, you know?

I don’t respond to this. The cloaked figure doesn’t say anything else, so I speak up again.

Emika: So what happens now? I stay here forever, or what…?

Cloaked figure: Oh no, nothing like that. You come with me in this boat across the water to meet Death. Death will judge the life you have lived. If you have lived a good life, you will be sent to heaven. If not, well…

Hearing this, I can’t help myself from grimacing.

Cloaked figure: Do I detect some chagrin? Taking the time to reflect on your choices, now of all times?

Emika: Is that sarcasm? You don’t seem to be taking this very seriously.

Cloaked figure: Hey, after you ferry enough people across, you’ve seen it all. People’s reactions are all the same.

I don’t respond to this.

Cloaked figure: Well, into the boat you go.

Emika: What if I don’t want to go.

I say it more like a statement than a question.

Cloaked figure: Oh, and why might that be? Do you still have things you need to do in the world of the living?

Emika: It’s not that… Look, I’ll be honest... Maybe I regret my decisions. Maybe I’m not happy with the life I lived. If I were to live again, I would do things differently.

Cloaked figure: Heheh, is that so…? I was hoping you would say that. The truth is, you have a choice. If you’re not satisfied with your own performance, you don’t have to get in the boat. I can send you back, back to any point in your life you want, and you can try living again. And again, and again, until you’re satisfied. You can try as many times as you like, until you’ve built a life that’s worth being judged for. There’s no good in bothering Death with some shoddy work of a life that you’re not even proud of yourself, now is there? Death will only judge you for the final product.

Emika: Seriously? I can try again?

Cloaked figure: Yes.

Emika: How do I know I won’t just make the same mistakes again? Will I retain my memories?

Cloaked figure: Sort of. You will forget coming to _this_ place. However, upon returning to a point in your life of your choosing, you will immediately see a vision of the future that details the remainder of your life up until your death, and even a brief vision of some events after your death. You will be convinced of the veracity of this vision. From there, it is up to you to use that information to make different decisions. 

Emika: That seems too easy. There must be some kind of catch.

Cloaked figure: No no, there is no catch. You can try as many times as you like. The only catch is that your soul will not reach eternal rest until you give up.

Emika: Something isn’t adding up here. Does everyone get to do this, when they die? Get the chance to go back and try again, I mean...

Cloaked figure: Oh, definitely not. Only certain distinguished individuals who have... erm… _significantly altered_ the balance of life and death in the world get this chance. 

Thinking back on all the people I have killed, both personally in battle and indirectly through my actions as emperor, I feel my heart sink. The cloaked figure doesn’t acknowledge my obvious distress, and continues:

Cloaked figure: It wouldn’t be interesting otherwise, right? You have to realize, Death is quite bored, and is only doing this for amusement. No sense in sending someone back if hardly anything will change, don’t you agree?

What do I even say to that? Is this just a game to Death? I feel like asking just what kind of an individual this Death really is, but I hold my tongue.

Emika: Fine then, I’ll go back.

Cloaked figure: Excellent. Simply turn around, and walk up the staircase that appears before you. You already know what moment you want to return to, right? Just thinking it will be enough.

I turn, and indeed, a staircase of light is there before me, stretching up into a patch of blinding light in the sky. Before I go, I consider thanking the cloaked figure, or maybe Death itself, for giving me this chance. But from what the figure was saying, Death doesn’t seem to care that much about me, treating me like a toy for its own entertainment, so I decide not to give it the satisfaction. I’m doing this for my own sake, not to satisfy the whims of this Death. Before I go, though, I do ask one more question:

Emika: Who are you, by the way? You, cloaked figure. Can I see your face?

Cloaked figure: I am merely an appendage of Death. My face is not interesting. Go on, then. You no longer have business here.

So I walk up the staircase, and return to _that_ moment…

A voice: Captain Yamamoto, High Valkyrie of Arcania, in recognition of your valor and services to the state, we’d like to offer you the position of Supreme General of the Arcanian Armed Forces. Do you accept?

I am standing in a regally decorated room. Ornately carved columns, velvet couches, baroque paintings, and a ceiling-height window surround me. I am 27 years old, wearing my dress uniform. Standing before me is  Ramus Iorys, the president of the Arcanian Republic. He is holding a richly decorated sword out to me.

Before I can even begin to think to answer, I foresee it all: what will happen if I accept. I foresee how as Supreme General, I will lead the Republic on a great conquest, slaughtering many innocents, burning towns, taking over much of the world, and eventually establishing myself as an absolute dictatorial empress. I foresee how, in the climactic battle in which I am supposed to easily defeat the last remaining rival power and effectively conquer the entire world, I will be killed by a random mis-fired cannon shot, and then, after my death, my empire will then lose the battle, the war, and eventually fall into chaos…

Seeing this vision, I am stunned, taking a moment to process everything I have just seen. Slowly, my mind refocuses on the present, and I bring my eyes up to meet those of Ramus, who is smiling expectantly at me. I don’t have much time to think, and I just blurt out:

Emika: I -- I humbly refuse!

I give a quick bow and then, without waiting for a response from the visibly shocked Ramus, I hurry out of the room, past the stunned guards, out of the building, across the street to the army headquarters, and back to my own room. I shut and lock the door, lie down in my bed, and think over what just happened, and what I will do next…

The next day, Yamamoto Emika resigned from the Arcanian military. Over the next few years, she would travel the world, seeking a new purpose in life. Eventually, she decided to become a teacher. In teacher school she met Tanaka Rin, and they became friends. They eventually went their separate ways, with Yamamoto becoming a wandering teacher of battle tactics, and Tanaka becoming a language arts teacher in Alice’s city. Once Alice left on her journey to the World Tree and Tanaka followed her, Tanaka wrote a letter to Yamamoto asking her to come help too, since Yamamoto was the strongest warrior she knew. Yamamoto, wishing to protect her only friend Tanaka, agreed without hesitation.
