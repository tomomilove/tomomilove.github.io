### Materials
- 1.5 teaspoons of matcha
- 3 tablespoons of water, 80 degrees celcius 
- 0.5 teaspoons of sugar
- 6 tablespoons of milk
- some honey
- whisk
- bowl
- cup
- hot water maker
- 1/2 teaspoon

Of course, all ingredient amounts can be adjusted to taste.

### Instructions

Begin by filtering the matcha into the bowl. Shake your filter to get the matcha to fall through. This should remove any clumps from the matcha.

Add the water and sugar, and whisk together. Try to make the mixture frothy. You may find it easier to whisk in a back-and-forth motion, rather than in circles.
