# About and disclaimers

Hello. I am the person who wrote this website. This website is a repository of my personal thoughts to be shared with anyone who is interested.

I expect that you, reader, will disagree with some of the ideas I've presented. That's okay. Actually, the main reason I'm writing this website is because I haven't seen these ideas commonly represented. If everyone already agreed with these ideas, then I wouldn't need to argue in favor of them, right? However, I hope that you will keep an open mind and at least consider my ideas.

## On mutability

This document and my ideas are mutable. They are open to being questioned and changed. A lot of my ideas may be no good, and I am willing to give up on them or replace them. 

Please keep in mind that just because I had these ideas at the time I was writing this website, it doesn't mean that I still have them today. This website may be outdated. I want to keep this website updated with my current thoughts, but no promises. Maybe one day I will forget about it, and it will languish on the internet.

## On misinterpretation

I recognize it's inevitable that many readers will misinterpret what I've written. Therefore, I plead you to be careful. Please, before getting angry at what I've written, carefully consider if you are understanding the *intent* behind the words. I mean no ill will towards anyone. My true wish is happiness for each and every person in the world. As you read through this website, please don't forget that.

In order to help guard against misinterpretation, I have used no sarcasm in this website. I find that it typically does not translate well over the internet.
