# On the world stage

## Tokyo

I didn't think I'd like a big city so much, but actually, I liked Tokyo quite a bit. Thoughts on some places we visited:

First we went to Asakusa, home of Bad Cat. It's touristy, maybe, but I think if you follow Bad Cat's advice and pay attention, you'll find a certain richness there.

We also went to the nearby Skytree. Thank you for convincing me to go up, because honestly, it was one of the highlights of the trip for me. Being up so high, I was able to get a real sense of just how massive Tokyo is, and that gave me a new kind of appreciation for it that I wouldn't have gotten otherwise. Just traveling by subway here and there, you don't really get a sense of the city you're going through.

Then we went to Waseda University. What a great surprise stumbling into the student film festival! I thought this was nice because it was beyond typical touristy experiences, since we got to see what kinds of things normal people in Tokyo have on their minds. I thought the film we saw was interesting. It didn't have much of a plot or resolution or anything, but for some reason it has stuck with me, and I still think about the relationships it presented.

We also spent some time in Ginza. It's fanciness was impressive, but for that reason I didn't feel all that comfortable there. Nice to visit though, and I definitely appreciate the warabi mochi we got there!

The imperial palace wasn't a very interesting place to visit on our trip, but I appreciate it for being a quiet space in the middle of the bustling city. Actually, I imagine if I lived in Tokyo, I would hang out there quite a lot.

Shibuya, I was surprised by just how bustling it was, even at night. Prior to our trip I had heard that Shibuya was a busy place, and I guess I'm surprised that this turned out to actually be the case! 

## Plane flight

Our flight to Japan was truly the unluckiest of flights. Delayed 7 hours, and they ran out of food by the time they reached our seats. Not to mention that the person sitting behind us had a medical emergency. At least we all made it through safely, eventually. 

There wasn't a whole lot we can do about that. Though, if I have one takeaway from the experience, it's to book tickets and choose seats earlier. Next time I'll try really hard to avoid sitting in the very back rows, if only to avoid missing out on food again. 

## Bordeaux

Bordeaux is such a beautiful city. It's so nice just to wander the twisting downtown streets, gander at the cathedrals and architecture, or just hang out at the water mirror. Everywhere you go just seems so friendly. I'm jealous of you getting to spend so much time there. I wish I had an opportunity to get to know it better myself, it really seems like a place I could be comfortable in.

## Davis

I've heard many people call Davis a boring town, but it will always be special to me. It's the place I grew up, a place where, as a kid, my imagination ran wild. A place where, as a kid, I watched for shooting stars to wish for love. You laugh at me for liking that UFO statue, but for me, I think of it as a symbol of Davis. It's a statue that suggests that something myesterious, something magical could happen happen in the ordinary town of Davis. In a way it represents my dreams as a kid, stuck in that small town.
 
Something interesting is that, to this day, when I think of what society and culture I feel most a part of, I don't think of American culture, or even Californian culture; I think of Davis culture specifically. It's got an emphasis on education and intellectualism, but with a simpleness and a slowness that you don't get in the Bay Area. Add in an appreciation of the outdoors, an appreciation of good food, and just a little bit of crazy, and I think that sums up Davis culture pretty well.

## Berkeley

I think of Berkeley as one center of world culture, a great crossroads where interesting people meet (including you and me!).

I grew up in Davis, and you grew up in San Jose, due to the choices of our parents (or from our perspective, essentially the hand of fate). But Berkeley was a place we both chose to go of our own will, and that is where we met. In other words, I think our meeting was not so much determined by chance, but rather by our own choices. I think that's interesting, the way in which some meetings seem to be a result of chance, and others not.

I'll always remember Berkeley as the place I grew up. I came into Berkeley foolish and weak, and left it competent but humbled. I'll always remember the mistakes I made there. I'll remember the painful, painful lessons I learned about interacting with other people there. How other people can be so strange and incomprehensible at times, but how this is perfectly okay, and you should still treat them with gentleness.

# Recipes

## Matcha Latte

Let's make a matcha latte!

![Matcha latte](/images/matcha_latte/complete.jpg)

### Materials
- 1.5 teaspoons of matcha
- 3 tablespoons of water, 80 degrees celcius 
- 0.5 teaspoons of sugar
- 6 tablespoons of milk
- some honey
- whisk
- bowl
- cup
- hot water maker
- 1/2 teaspoon

Of course, all ingredient amounts can be adjusted to taste.

### Instructions

Begin by filtering the matcha into the bowl. Shake your filter to get the matcha to fall through. This should remove any clumps from the matcha.

![Filtering](/images/matcha_latte/filter.jpg)

Add the water and sugar, and whisk together. Try to make the mixture frothy. You may find it easier to whisk in a back-and-forth motion, rather than in circles.

![Whisking](/images/matcha_latte/whisk.jpg)

Put a layer of honey in the bottom of your cup.

![Honey](/images/matcha_latte/honey.jpg)

# Thoughts

## Reflections on two years

Dearest Tomomi,

We've been together for two years now. Are you surprised we've been together so long? I'm not surprised, myself. Today, just the same as two years ago, I feel that our relationship makes complete sense to me. That it feels right. That it feels like the kind of life I want to live.

Though, some things have changed between us in these two years. Do you remember how, at our first holiday party together, I was unwilling to dance? But a few days ago, we were able to dance together, and have a lot of fun. I'm not sure if that means anything to you, but to me, it is a sign of the great trust I have in you.

I melt around you Tomomi. The cold, hard exterior I present to most people falls away, and I can be joyful with you.

But along with this, I realize that I can sometimes be vulnerable and weak around you. So I want to thank you for putting up with this childishness of mine. I'm not always in a good mood. For example, sometimes I can't help but feel disappointed when you don't have time to spend with me. I really do understand you, I really understand why you can't always spend time with me, but even so I'm not always in control of my emotions. I think that's a weakness of mine. But you never seem to hold it against me. No matter how many times I mess up, I feel that you still love me. I'm really grateful for that. But even so, I'm going to try to improve.

Thank you for always being on my side. You are my dearest companion as I make my way through the world. It pains me to say this, but recently I think that the world is quite a dark and unfriendly place. A world filled with lies and deceits, where too many people just want to get ahead for themselves even while hurting other people. This thought overwhelms me somtimes. I feel that I am just a tiny speck, as the chaos of the world swirls around me. But I do not mind walking through the dark if you're holding my hand, Tomomi. Because you're someone I know I can trust.

I love you Tomomi. I want nothing more than to make our way through this world, bravely into the future, supporting each other, together.

## Things you do for me

You do so much for me, and I want to appreciate that! So I've compiled a list of things you do for me. I'll update it as I think of more things.

#### You drive me places

You have spent countless hours driving me. Sometimes it's for us, so we can do something fun together. Other times it's just for me, so I can get dinner without having to walk there myself. Either way, driving takes effort, and it carries with it a responsibility for keeping us safe. Driving is something that I'm even scared of doing myself, and that makes me appreciate you taking on the burden that much more.

#### You wash our dishes (and my roommates' dishes!)

It's a chore that I don't like to do, and you're always doing it for me. I'm trying to get better about helping you with this!

#### You cook for me

Even when you're at my place, you will cook for me. Often we cook together, but if I ever hesitate or take a break, you will keep going on your own! I have to keep taking initiative just to keep up with you.

#### You make calls for me

I never liked talking on the phone, and it's so nice that you are the one who calls restaurants to ask for reservations, and things like that. I would do it if you asked, but you just jump right into it!

#### You make my bed

#### You prepare my toothbrush

#### You fixed my blind for me

#### You cover my ears when the train comes

#### You buy food for me

#### You remind me to get dinner

#### You show me funny pictures, videos, and stories

#### You laugh with me

Lots of little things, but they mean a lot to me!

#### You text me good morning and sometimes call

It makes me feel like the day is worth it.

#### You visit me

I don't know if you can understand how much this means to me, but really, it's what keeps me going. What's the point of life if you're not living it with someone you love?

#### You hold me and kiss me

A lot of times I feel like the world is a scary, dark, or overwhelming place. Nothing gives me more comfort than snuggling with you.

#### You see the good in me

I make a lot of mistakes, but you always give me the benefit of the doubt. You always trust that my heart is in the right place.

#### You love me

You love me and you show it, which means more to me than anything in the world.

# Arts and crafts

## The searching man

Let's make the searching man!

![Complete searching man](/images/searching_man/complete.jpg)

### Materials
- Some blue pipecleaners (aka chenille stems) and one green one.
- Red felt.
- A bit of white paper. Preferably something thicker than printer paper, such as cardstock.
- Something to stick felt together. Hot glue is one option, sewing is another. Regular paper glue probably won't work.

### Instructions

#### Part 1: The empty man

![The empty man](/images/searching_man/empty_man.jpg)

Once upon a time there was a man with no heart. The only thing inside him was emptiness.

Let's begin by making the lower half of the body. Take one pipecleaner and twist it into the following shape.

![Lower body](/images/searching_man/lower_body.jpg)

Use a second pipecleaner to add the arms and neck. Be sure to wrap the shoulders around the top of the string so that they are locked in place.

![Neck and arms](/images/searching_man/neck_and_arms.jpg)

Bend the neck. This will be the nose.

![Nose](/images/searching_man/nose.jpg)

Wrap multiple pipelcleaners around the nose and neck to create the head. This doesn't have to be exact. Just add as many as you think look good, and squish them into a nice shape.

![Head](/images/searching_man/head.jpg)

Glue on the eyes. They're just little pieces of paper with pen markings.

![Eyes](/images/searching_man/empty_man.jpg)

#### Part 2: The searching man

![The searching man](/images/searching_man/searching_man.jpg)

One day the empty man decided he wasn't satisfied with being empty. He decided he wanted a heart. But how to get one? He had no idea, so he decided to wander the world in search of one.

Of course, he couldn't go out searching without his favorite adventurer's coat. Let's build his coat now.

Here are the different pieces we'll need. From top to bottom they are: A collar, the front and back of the torso, an arm, a belt, and coattails.

![Coat pieces](/images/searching_man/coat_pieces.jpg)

In my case, the width of the front of the coat at the waist is 3cm. This means that the belt and coattails are 6cm wide, since they have to wrap around the back. I've drawn dashes where they could be folded around back.

As I've done here, I recommend making paper versions of all the pieces and checking their size against the empty man before cutting out the actual felt.

Once you've done, cut out the coattails and glue them to the empty man.

![Coattails](/images/searching_man/coattails.jpg)

Fold the edges of the coattails in front and glue the belt on top, keeping them in place.

![Belt](/images/searching_man/belt.jpg)

Attach the back of the torso.

![Torso back](/images/searching_man/torso_back.jpg)

Make the torso front. Add some collar detail.

![Torso collar](/images/searching_man/torso_collar.jpg)

Put on the torso front, tucking it under the belt. Also wrap the belt around and fasten it. Glue the top of the front torso piece to the top of the back torso piece, but do _not_ glue their sides together. Leave them open, so we can insert the sleeves later.

![Torso front](/images/searching_man/torso_front.jpg)

Add the sleeves.

![Sleeves](/images/searching_man/sleeves.jpg)

Finally, attach the collar on the back. (Also notice that I had to due some stitching to get things to stay)

![Collar](/images/searching_man/collar.jpg)

Now we're done! But the searching man looks a little perplexed. He searched the world over for many days and many nights, but he could never find a heart...

![The searching man](/images/searching_man/searching_man.jpg)

#### Part 3: The cultivating man

Exhausted from his long search, the searching man was forced to conclude that he would never find a heart. That's when he thought of a new idea: he would grow one! 

So he ripped a shred of cloth from his coat, planted it in the ground, and watered it every day. Soon enough, a sprout emerged from the ground and started to grow. He continued to take care of it dilligently. He watered it without fail, shielded it from the sun when it was too hot, and made sure to adjust it if it started growing crooked. It was a lot of work, but he kept going, knowing that one day it would grow into a beautiful heart that he could call his own.

To be continued...?
