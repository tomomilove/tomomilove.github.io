## Into the labyrinth
This week, Alice, Tanaka, John, Lee, and Yamamoto begin their journey into the labyrinth... [Click here](/story#９章) to jump to the latest chapter of the story.

# 30 August
## Locked out
Today, for the first time that I can remember, I left my key at home when I went to work! I guess what happened is that I had put the keys in my pants pocket when getting dressed, but then I decided to change pants at the last minute before I left. Normally I always check for my keys before closing the door on the way out, but I didn't today, and I'm not sure why. Maybe I was just preoccupied? I got as far as the apartment complex stairs before realizing my mistake. I could have tried to contact my roommates right then I try to get back in, but in that case I likely would have missed the bus.

Luckily I was able to contact my roommates later in the day, and they were able to let me in when I returned from work. Crisis averted!

## Infinite City
While I was cleaning my room, I found this book, _Infinite City_
![Infinite City](/images/blog_august/infinite_city.jpg)

I remember receiving this as a gift, but I can't remember from who or for what reason. Do you know? Maybe it was a gift from a work colleague upon switching teams...?

Anyway, this book features a lot of maps of San Francisco and the bay area, most of which juxtapose two topics, many of which are seemingly unrelated. I don't think the point of the book is to suggest any causation; it just wants you to think about it, I guess.

For example, here's one that juxtaposes murders (in red) and cyprus trees (in green).
![Cypress trees map](/images/blog_august/cypress_trees_map.jpg)

There's a pretty strong east-west divide, isn't there?

Here's a map showing locations that produce food juxtaposed with locations that produce poisonous substances:

![Food and poison map](/images/blog_august/food_and_poison_map.jpg)

I'm not sure whether or not we should be concerned with posionous substance production in our region. Does it get into the food somehow? I'm not sure.

Here's one that has coffee shops as well as the major water lines and sewage lines in the city. According to the book, the point is to get you to think about where the water in your coffee comes from, and where it goes.

![Coffee map](/images/blog_august/coffee_map.jpg)

Here's another interesting one about water. It shows the natural land mass of San Francisco, the artificial land that was creating by filling in water, and the land that would be lost if the sea level rises due to global warming.

![Land and water map](/images/blog_august/land_and_water_map.jpg)

Oh and here's a map about public landmarks that might be interesting to visit:

![Public landmarks map](/images/blog_august/public_landmarks_map.jpg)

It's one of the last maps in the book. I guess the point is to challenge you before showing you the "obvious" map of the city.

## Kombucha

So at my work they now have kombucha:

![Kombucha 1](/images/blog_august/kombucha1.jpg)
![Kombucha 2](/images/blog_august/kombucha2.jpg)

Kombucha is a thing I've seen around a lot, especially in stores like Whole Foods, but I never knew what it was. So I decided to look it up and was surprised to discover that it's actually tea! More specifically, a kind of fermented tea. I'll let [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha) explain:

"Kombucha (also tea mushroom, Manchurian mushroom, formal name: Medusomyces gisevii) is a variety of fermented, lightly effervescent sweetened black or green tea drinks commonly intended as functional beverages for their supposed health benefits. Kombucha is produced by fermenting tea using a 'symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast' (SCOBY)."

Wikipedia then goes on to mention:

"Numerous claims of health benefits have been made from drinking kombucha, but there is no scientific evidence to support this view."

Just a marketing gimmick, I guess? Not something that sounds very tasty either. But then again, _for the blog_, I had to give it a go, right? And, well, um... it tastes basically like it is described, I guess? Imagine tea, mixed with soda, mixed with... the fermentedness of yogurt. I was not a fan. I couldn't get very far before I had to give up on it!

## A chance for better internet?
When I was cleaning the closet the other day, I found my old router. Also, when I was cleaning my room, I uncovered a phone jack on the wall. So I thought to myself: Could I connect my router to the phone jack via ethernet and get better internet in my room?

![Happy router](/images/blog_august/happy_router.jpg)
I could be useful!

However, I talked to Khalil about it, and he said that probably wouldn't work.

![Sad router](/images/blog_august/sad_router.jpg)
I am not useful...

Instead, he said I could use something called a powerline adapter. You just plug it into a normal power outlet actually. Apparently, this is how his TV gets internet.

I looked it up, and it costs about $40 or so. I'm not sure if I should get it. On the one hand, better internet would definitely be worth a one-time $40 cost. On the other hand, I'm not actually sure how much the internet would improve, if at all. And $40 is a bit much just to experiment.

# 26 August
## Search bar and header changes
I added a search bar to the site. It uses something called Google Custom Search Engine. From my tests, it doesn't seem to be particularly great for this site: The problem is that it searches for pages, but each blog post isn't on its own page. So in the end, it can only bring you to the correct blog month page, rather than to the specific blog post. I guess that's better than nothing, though?

By the way, it's possible to search by URL directly, instead of using the search bar. For example, to search for "berkeley" on the site, you can just use [http://www.tomomilove.com/search_results/?q=berkeley](/search_results/?q=berkeley). Just put whatever you want to search for after the "?q=" part.

Also, unfortunately, the results page has ads. It's actually very easy for me to remove them, but that's against the terms of service, so I figure I should leave them. You can use ad blocking, though? In the future, I may try to find something else that's ad free, but I guess this is good enough for now.

By the way, you might also notice that I removed some of the header links, such as "Arts and Crafts" and "Travel Diary". I put them in a blog page called "Older". The reason I did this is because there were starting to be a lot of header links, and it was getting crowded. Also, I think if I were to write these kinds of things today, I would have put them in the blog. What do you think of this change? If you would like me to put any of them back, I can.

## Review over the list of things that weigh on my mind
We were talking about my list of things that weigh on my mind, so I thought I would write out the whole thing in this post, as well as comment on the current status of each point!

1. _I'm not successful at work:_ Well, as mentioned in yesterday's blog post, I reached a milestone on something I've been working on recently. So finally I have been making some progress. I still feel like I am not doing great, but I think I am doing reasonably well.

2. _I don't enjoy work:_ Actually, I feel that I enjoy work even less now. Every day, I am counting down the time until I get to go home. That's not a great situation to be in, right? Part of the reason is that my life outside of work is so much more interesting, like I really want to get to my learning Japanese and writing.

3. _I can't find good shoes:_ This one is resolved, actually. A while ago I bought some really expensive shoes. I didn't like wearing them because they hurt my ankle, but I also couldn't return them because I wore them outside once. I tried really hard to break them in, but it wasn't working. I tried all sorts of crazy solutions. In the end, I felt that I had wasted a ton of money, and on top of that, I couldn't find any good shoes to wear instad. However, there has been an update since then. I found that those shoes actually won't hurt my ankle if I take out the insole I was using. I liked the insole because it makes walking feel softer. But I tried wearing the shoes without the insole, and eventually found I could get used to it. Now I wear those shoes every day and they are fine!

4. _Tomomi wants me to drive but I don't want to drive:_ Is this one resolved? Last I remember we had an agreement that I would pay for dinners and things if you drive. Is that working out for you? I feel like this hasn't been an issue recently, but if it's still bothering you, you should let me know.

   In truth, I am willing to re-learn driving at some point in the future. What's stopping me now is that I'm not in a situation where I would need to drive often. The only times in my current life that driving would be useful to me would be occassionally on the weekends, and I think that is not often enough that I could keep practiced. I have crashed before due to my own inexperience, so if I am going to drive again I want to make sure I am regularly practiced. I think the fear of my own inexperience is the main fear that keeps me from driving.

5. _I make so many mistakes while cooking:_ I guess this is still true, but for some reason it's not really bothering me much anymore. I guess this is just an attitude thing?

6. _I eat too many sweets:_ You may not be aware of this, but there are lots of nice chocolates and sugar-filled snacks at work that are easy to eat. I have been cutting down on them though, so I feel a little bit better about this one. I've also stopped going out to get desserts on weekends on my own (such as milk tea). I think normal tea is just as good, so I might as well go with the healthier and cheaper option.

7. _I don't eat enough vegetables:_ This one is still an issue. Whether it's at work or while eating out, much of the time I don't get a lot of vegetables with my meal. This is partially my own fault of course, with my own food choice. I think the main problem I face here is that vegetable foods often just aren't as tasty. What can be done about that?

8. _I spend too much money on food:_ This one is as bad as ever, and it's because I eat out so much. I could save a lot of money by eating dinner at work, but then I would have to stay late which I don't want to do. I could also save a lot of money by cooking dinner, but it's just so time consuming. If I spend every night cooking, then I'm not going to have time to read and write and things, right? My other option is to buy frozen foods and convenience foods from grocery stores, but these never taste very good. Relating to the next item on the list...

9. _I can't find good food:_ Compared to Japan, I just can't find good food here. Not at working, not eating out, not cooking myself. And there's a tradeoff: food that is tastier tends to be less healthy (without vegetables), and to cost a lot of money. So how I can find the right balance of healthy food, cheap food, and tasty food?

10. _I don't exercise:_ This is important for my health, but I haven't done it because I find exercise very boring to do by myself. I think I would enjoy things like running with you, or even going to the gym with you, but maybe I don't see you often enough for that. If it's something you're interested in though, let me know and we could try!

11. _I can't keep everything clean:_ It's a never ending battle of keeping the floor vacuumed, the shower clean, the toilet clean, things dusted, and more. I know my roommates hire people to clean, but I don't want to do that. Back at home, I know my mom used to spend every Friday cleaning the whole house. I guess I could spend the time to do that, I just think there are other things I'd rather do more? It's hard to find the right balance.

And that's all the things remaining on the list. Writing them all out, they don't seem insurmountable.

Also, roughly half of them are about food, huh? Maybe I should prioritize working on food issues. I could try an initiative such as at least one home-cooked dinner per week?

## Phishing problem
_Phishing_ is a situation where someone tries to trick someone else into revealing their personal information. This usually happens by pretending to be someone that person trusts.

When phishing through email, phishers often include a link in the email that is pretending to be a link to a trusted site. For example, a phisher could send an email that asks you to view a file by cliking a link like https://dropbox-secure-login[.]com. This is not the real Dropbox login page, but if the person clicks the link, they will find a fake Dropbox login page that the phisher has set up, which asks for username and password.

Something I've been working on at work is a way to detect these fake links. Given a link like https://dropbox-secure-login.com, is there a way for a computer to detect that link is pretending to be a link to a trusted site? Unfortunately, I don't think I am allowed to say exactly what my work is. However, I thought you might be interested to know what the problem is. Perhaps, in an idle moment, you might find it fun to think about how you would solve the problem? 

Also, there's a reason I'm writing about this today. After months of work, I hit a big milestone today! Though unfortunately, I guess I shouldn't specifically say what this is, either... Writing about work is hard!

## Article about "Hidden secrets and legends" at Berkeley
Someone at work linked [this article](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/cal-myths-legends-lore-facts-berkeley-13107925.php) about interesting things at Berkeley. 

You can go read that article if you want, but honestly, the website is kind of a mess, so I'll summarize some of the more interesting ones for you. Full credit for the photos and information go to the original article, I'm pretty much just copying it here for you!

![Mining tunnels](https://s.hdnux.com/photos/26/77/47/6027736/5/1024x1024.jpg)

Apparently, ~100 years ago some mining students actually dug mining tunnels underneath the campus for coursework. It says they had to blast and dig it out -- I guess that means they had to use dyanmite! I can't imagine that would be allowed today...

![Hyenas](https://s.hdnux.com/photos/40/31/65/8494403/3/1024x1024.jpg)

Up until last year, researchers kept a colony of hyenas someowhere in the hills. Apparently they served as a reference for animators on _The Lion King_.

![Dog](https://s.hdnux.com/photos/36/60/24/8062257/9/1024x1024.jpg)

There was a dog that once got a degree, thanks to his owner taking all of his tests for him. The dog is now buried at Bowles hall.

![Pelican statue](https://s.hdnux.com/photos/40/41/12/8524446/3/1024x1024.jpg)

The pelican statue is a reference to _The California Pelican_, a humor magazine at Cal. The statue is in front of this building because the building's donor is the person who ran the magazine.

And that's about it! I have to say, I didn't know these ones, and I thought I had learned a lot of Berkeley lore. The deep history of the campus continues to surprise me!

## Getting the band together
Last week, Alice started a guild and reluctantly recruited John to fill the critical role of healer. However, she still needs two more guild members...

Oh by the way, I also decided to give the story the title! It is now called 怖がりじゃないクロニクルス (Kowagarijanai Chronicles). I wrote the title at the top of the story page.

## Cleaning day 3: The closet
Today I cleaned out my closet. If you were to look inside, I bet you wouldn't notice a difference. However, I actually got rid of more than an entire trash bag full of stuff! Some highlights from the cleaning:

- By getting rid of old clothes that I never wear, I freed up enough hangers so that I can hang up all of the clothes I do wear! Before I was leaving clothes on the floor of the closet because I didn't have enough hangers...

- I found a long lost plug for my macbook charger! This allows me to make the charger cord length shorter, making it better for travel. I also found a couple of more things i had lost, such as my other pillow case.

- I fit the excess blankets into the closet! Now the corner is finally free!

It feels nice to get rid of things, but in the future, I'll have to try my best to not accumulate so much stuff in the first place.

# 19 August
## Cleaning day 2: Tea box
Time to get rid of the old tea box...

![Tea box](/images/blog_august/tea_box.jpg)

There are some interesting things in here, many of them gifts. It breaks my heart to get rid of them, but I think overall it is for the best.

This one has a nice container, but unfortunately the tea itself wasn't very good:

![Rose tea](/images/blog_august/rose_tea.jpg)

Here's the Earl Grey tea I mentioned. Bought at Berkeley Bowl. It says it was packed on September 22, but of which year...?

![Earl grey](/images/blog_august/earl_grey.jpg)

This one is pretty old, too...

![Prince of wales](/images/blog_august/prince_of_wales.jpg)

I'm keeping these ones though!

![Tea keepers](/images/blog_august/tea_keepers.jpg)

The Paris tea was still good last time I had it. Also, it's nice to have a back-up tea for when I run out of my main tea and haven't ordered any more. And barley tea is always nice to keep around for when I don't want any caffeine. I like drinking it hot, at nights.

# 18 August
## Cleaning day 1: Bed
You are a super hero!

Today we got rid of the bed frame that has been sitting in my room for more than a year. Maybe more than two? And now you have my mattress sitting in my car...

I wonder why I never got rid of it before? Maybe it's because I knew I needed your help, and I felt shy about asking you for the favor. So thank you so much for helping me!  Actually, it was possible for me to get rid of myself: I could have called a junk pick-up service. But that would have cost me in $100+, so you saved me a bunch!

It feels good to end a years old problem. Now I feel motivated to end some more!

# 17 August
## 怖がりじゃない
Last week, Alice and Tanaka traveled to the town of Maginia in hopes of exploring Yggdrasil, The World Tree. Alice's goal is to find the legendary treasure said to be hidden in Yddrasil that can grant any wish. But in order to explore Yggdrasil, Alice will need to start a guild and assemble a team of adventurers to help her...

##  Seafood doria
Cooking day! Today I made [this seafood doria recipe](https://www.justonecookbook.com/seafood-doria/).

As always, I have to start with the _mise en place_:
![Seafood doria mise en place](/images/blog_august/seafood_doria_mise_en_place.jpg)

In progress!
![Seafood doria in progress](/images/blog_august/seafood_doria_in_progress.jpg)

Done!
![Seafood doria done](/images/blog_august/seafood_doria_done.jpg)

Plated!
![Seafood doria plated](/images/blog_august/seafood_doria_plated.jpg)

It wasn't bad! Next time, I think I will either add more salt to the bechemel sauce, or add more cheese (for its saltiness).

# 15 August
## A day at home
I succeeded in getting the lights fixed today! I had to stay home from work, which is why I put it off for so long.

Staying home from work isn't so bad. I can still do some work from my laptop. Also, there are some special things to do at home on a weekday: for example, I can go to a nearby restaurant called Hunan Home's Express. Normally I can't go to this restaurant, because their dishes are too big for me, meant be to served family style. However, on weekdays at lunch, they have a lunch buffet which is good for one person!

The other thing I can do at home in the daytime is drink my Asha's house black tea! Normally I only drink it on weekends, because if I were to drink it after work, it would be too late in the day. So it's a nice treat to be able to have it on a weekday. You might ask: Why don't I just bring the tea to work and drink it there? Well, I've tried this actually, but for some reason, it's never as good there. I'm not sure why... maybe because I don't have proper measuring spoons there?

I also got to see you today at home! And we had tea and delicious cake together. We should do that more often on the weekdays!

# 14 August
## The beauty of trees
If the world ever seems too mean or too inane, being around trees helps calm me down. I guess it's their calmness and their beauty. And also how they are aloof from the human world, as the pitfalls of human morality don't apply to them.

I would like to be as calm and enduring as a tree.

Anyway, today I decided to go around the neighborhood and take photos of some of the coolest trees I found. Please enjoy them!

![Tree 1](/images/blog_august/tree1.jpg)
![Tree 2](/images/blog_august/tree2.jpg)

## Moving day
My team was moved to a new building at work today. It's the building right next to my old one. Our new floor appears to be robot themed. They have this robot arm on display:

![Robot arm](/images/blog_august/robot_arm.jpg)

And there's this robot schematic on the wall:

![Robot schematic](/images/blog_august/robot_schematic.jpg)

Also, a lot of the walls have photos of old robot toys like this:

![Robot Lilliput](/images/blog_august/robot_lilliput.jpg)

This one says "Robot Lilliput" on it. Do you know Lilliput? It is a kingdom of tiny people featured in the story [Gulliver's Travels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulliver%27s_Travels). I wonder why they called this one "Robot Lilliput". I'm not sure what the connection is, other than it being a toy so it's small?

Finally, one of the walls has this contraption:

![Drawing spinner](/images/blog_august/drawing_spinner.jpg)

Have you seen this kind of thing before (maybe not on a wall)? You turn the crank and the arm draws in a circle pattern. If you move some of the pieces around, turning the crank will cause it to draw interesting patterns like the designs on the wall here. Usually these kinds of contraptions are done with pen and paper, but this one is a white board on the wall. I tried using it a little bit, but I couldn't quite figure some things out, and I didn't want to break it, so I didn't end up drawing anything.

# 12 August
## Deeper exploration into THE VILLAGE
So I walked through THE VILLAGE today and noticed some curious things. First of all, there are these posts with quotes about technology on them:

![Technology quote 1](/images/blog_august/technology_quote1.jpg)
![Technology quote 2](/images/blog_august/technology_quote2.jpg)
![Technology quote 3](/images/blog_august/technology_quote3.jpg)

That's a bit silly if you ask me.

Also there's this fountain area (no water yet). You can't tell from this picture, but the lights on the ground glow rainbow colors.

![Fountain](/images/blog_august/fountain1.jpg)

Also a curious sign about the fountain:

![Fountain sign](/images/blog_august/fountain2.jpg)

# 11 August
## THE VILLAGE
The path through THE VILLAGE center opened up! You can walk all the way through now:

![THE VILLAGE](/images/blog_august/the_village1.jpg)

No stores are open or anything. Just the path. Anyway, it's a pretty nice path. There's a plaza-like area in the middle where cars can't get to, so it's nice for walking. I'll try going through here next time.

![THE VILLAGE plaza](/images/blog_august/the_village2.jpg)

There's this art/statue/fountain too. It's that kind of typical generic corporate art that doesn't really mean anything or look very interesting:

![THE VILLAGE fountain](/images/blog_august/the_village3.jpg)

Actually, I think there's something a little dystopian about THE VILLAGE:

![THE VILLAGE logo](/images/blog_august/the_village4.jpg)

I guess it's the way it uses the term "the village", but is actually the complete opposite of what a village is. To me, the word "village" brings to mind a small town, community feel, where everyone knows everyone one, and people have to work hard to scrape by. But this place is a fancy corporate shopping area.

But who knows, maybe it will turn out well. The plaza area is nice, and I like to imagine one day it will be bustling and full of life.

# 10 August
## The adventure begins
I wrote the first couple of chapters to my story, and I've posted them in a [new page](/story). Sorry, I'm sure there will be a lot of terrible problems with it, awkward grammar and odd word choice! I don't expect you to go through and provide corrections, as that would be a huge waste of your time. However, if you notice any major problems, or mistakes I keep making over and over again, I'd appreciate if you let me know! Also, if there's anything you don't understand about the story, feel free to ask me!

I should say, for future chapters, I probably won't post so much at once. However, for the beginning, I felt like I needed to post a decent chunk.

By the way, something you might not notice: The main characters in this story are based on the characters used in the example sentences in Tae Kim's website: アリス, ジョン, リー, 田中先生, and 山本先生. Since the purpose of this writing is to help me learn Japanese, I thought it made sense to keep using them. Now, please enjoy the story!

## Lights repairs
I did it! I sent an email to request someone come to repair our lights!

I wonder why I put off sending that email for so long. Why is it such a struggle for me? 

Maybe it's just a general sense of shyness, but I think there's something more. I think there's also a sense of guilt (behind most shyness there is guilt, isn't there?). Part of me feels that maybe I should have tried to fix the light myself. I would have had to get a ladder, figure out how to open the glass cover, then find a replacement bulb. I feel that I _should_ do that, yet I never actually do. But the feeling that I should prevents me from sending the email.

Actually, now that I've written this out, replacing the light myself doesn't sound so hard. I guess the most difficult part would be getting the ladder. I don't have a place to put it, or any other uses for it, so it seems like kind of a waste to buy one. On the other hand, I worry about wasting someone else's time, asking them to repair it.

What would you have done in this situation?

# 8 August
## ジョー書
As I mentioned in the previous day's blog post, I've been playing a game in Japanese.

Whenever I come across a word I don't know (which is nearly every word at this point), I look it up on jisho.org. That's fine and all, but how am I going to _learn_ this vocabulary for myself? Eventually, I should get to a point where I'm not looking up every word, right?

I've decided to write down every word I come across, along with its definition, on paper.

![Joesho](/images/blog_august/joesho.jpg)

This is very slow going at first, but eventually, I will start hitting duplicate words, right? Then I can look them up in my own handwritten dictionary (the "Joesho"... it's like a pun on "jisho", get it?), instead of looking them up online. I think that will help me learn better, if I rely more on resources I wrote myself. Also using handwriting should help with learning, right? I'm getting pretty good at kanji stroke order now, and I think that helps me remember some things.

However, there are so many words, I soon ran into the problem of how to organize them. For now, I've decided to organize them by the radical of the first kanji in the word, where each radical is a separate page.

Let me know if you have a better idea of how to organize these. I'm worried that as the amount of vocabulary grows, this organization scheme will no longer be good enough. Maybe I'll just have to to start cutting out less useful words.

## 世界樹の迷宮Ｘ 
So I've been playing a Japanese game I bought titled 世界樹の迷宮Ｘ. It's the newest game in the 世界樹の迷宮 series. I played the previous game in the series in English, and I enjoyed it.

The game is an RPG with a turn-based battle system, similar to Pokemon. Here are a few things this series is known for:
- It's quite difficult.
- The dungeons you explore are maze-like. Also, the game doesn't give you a map. Instead, you draw the map yourself as you go along, on the 3DS's bottom screen.
- There isn't much of a story, or a defined set of characters. Instead, you create your own characters, and you're encouraged to imagine your own story to go along with them.

That last aspect is why I thought it would be a good game for me to play in Japanese. I am planning to write out the story of my characters as I go along, for Japanese writing practice. This is the story I mentioned to you earlier. I think this is good because the game gives me some structure to work from: if I'm not feeling very creative, I can just write about the things that happened in the game. But when possible, I'll also try to tell the story of my characters and their personalities.

In this game, you can have 5 characters in your party at a time. They all fight together at once, and each one is supposed to have a different role in battle. For example, some of of your characters focus on attacking, then maybe one focuses on defending, and another focuses on healing. There is a huge variety of skills and abilities you can give your characters, and building a party whose skills work well together is the key to victory (much like in Pokemon).

I've already started planning some back stories and personalities for my characters, but it might be a while before I actually start writing the story. I'd like to progress through the game a bit more before I start. And as you might expect, my progress through the game is very slow.

## This blog now has multiple pages!
This blog has a lot of images, so I thought it would be nice to split into pages.

When you click the "Blog" button at the top, you now have the option to select which month's blog to view!

This functionality was made possible using the programming language [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). It's the first instance of JavaScript on this site.

Did you know that there are typically three programming languages involved on any given web page?

1. **HTML** is a programming language that defines the _structure and content_ of the page. In HTML, you decide where to place various elements (title at the top, footer at the bottom, etc). You also write the text of of the page in HTML, and place content within it, such as images.

2. **CSS** is a programming language that defines the _styling_ of the page. In CSS, you set the colors, the fonts, and how big or small elements are allowed to be.

3. **JavaScript** is a programming language that handles the _action logic_ of the page. You can write code that causes something to happen if a user clicks a button, moves their mouse, or types something in. In this case, there is some JavaScript code that runs when you click the "Blog" button.

Does using three programming language for one web page seem like a hassle to you? Because it totally is! For this reason (and many others), web development is a big mess. It's like this because when the web was originally designed, all it had was HTML. CSS and JavaScript were tacked on later, after it became clear that more options for styling and action handling were necessary.

## Automatic lights
My automatic light in the bathroom is really the worst. It always turns on when I don't want it (like when I need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and don't want to see bright light), and it always turns off when I don't want it (like when I'm standing still in the shower).

Well this time it decided to one-up itself in badness by becoming flickering. I find this very annoying. 

However, all hope is not lost. There is actually another light in my bathroom: A manual one by the mirror, which does not flicker. So I could use that one exclusively, if only I could prevent the automatic light from turning on (hard to do, since it's automatic).

Luckily I came up with a solution: Cover it up so it never turns on!

It seems to work kinda? Further testing is necessary, but this is a promising solution for now.

## Santa Cruz trip!
We went on an extended weekend trip to Santa Cruz!

Our first stop was a hidden, isolated beach. We had to navigate past several DO NOT ENTER signs that technically didn't forbid us from getting to the beach. Along the way we found these abandoned train tracks, overrun by grass:

I think there's something beautiful about them. We'd see them several times throughout Santa Cruz.

Later that day we headed to the Boardwalk, and you rode a number of crazy rides, such as these two:

Are you really not scared when you ride these? Even on the small ride I did, I felt that if I let go of the handle bar I would have died. I guess that's not true, but that's how I felt!

The next day, we went to the forest of Nisene Marks, which is always beautiful.

Here's you surrounded by forest. Isn't it majestic?

On the last day, we found some tide pools. Did you know these were here, or did we just find them randomly?

You really liked this spot in particular. I like it too!

It was an awesome trip overall! In the past I thought of the Boardwalk as a silly thing, but with you there this time I really did make some great memories there.

## Beefsteak
So a new lunch cafe opened up at my work called "Beefsteak". I heard it was burger themed. I'm not a huge fan of bugers, but I went to go check it out, since it is new, anyway.

When I got there, I learned it was actually a primarily vegetarian cafe! Their signature "beefsteak burger" is actually named for the [Beefsteak tomato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beefsteak_tomato). I guess the name is supposed to be a joke. They also had "poke bowls" on the menu, but with beets instead of fish (I'm not sure what the connection is there). Anyway, I'm not really a fan of tomatoes or beets, so I didn't end up getting anything.

I think if I had a vegetarian lunch cafe, I would put french onion soup on the menu, instead of tomato burgers! If you had to make a vegetarian cafe, what would your signature dish be?
